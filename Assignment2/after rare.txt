g to work one day, headed to one of the hostels around berlin to pick people up 
for the tour, and then bring them back to the gate where the tour starts ',ne
' as i was preparing to leave, one guy over at the yelled out for me to wait, me
 and said hello ',ne
' so he just took his backpack with him and came on my tour ',ne
' we had a great time catching up, and went out that night together as well ',hp
' but it s certainly strange how you randomly run in to people you haven t seen 
in years, in little hole-in-the-walls in europe ',sp
' fun times ',hp
' and this particular piece was by far the best play i have ever seen ',hp
' it was also incredibly simple, cutting the huge cast down to only seven perfor
mers ',sp
' it s moments like that that remind me why i ve chosen theatre as a ',ne
' i was lucky enough to be able to stay with some friends to cut down on the cos
t, and see a different side of london life ',hp
' it was sooooo much fun ',hp
' i saw most of the major on my own, and i went to the theater almost every nigh
t i was there ',ne
' the show was ',dg
' horrible ',dg
' horribly acted, horribly directed, weak ',dg
' and long ',dg
' three hours of ',dg
' i wanted to leave at intermission, but my was really enjoying it (should have 
been a sign) so we stayed ',hp
' i guess the one good thing i took from it was that i know now that the british
 are just as capable as we are of producing really awful work ',dg
' while in london i also saw at the theater ',ne
' now this was amazing ',sp
' the performers were incredible, and one of the was played by geoffrey, the fro
m fresh prince of ',sp
' that in itself was hilarious, and made us love the show even more ',hp
' i also saw for the first time, and it was fun ',hp
' loved london ',hp
' loved the free museums ',hp
' especially the british museum ',ne
' soooo many monuments, including two statues in front of that had a communist '
,ne
' now maybe i was just reading too much into this, or maybe i had spent too much
 time in the eastern talking about communist ',ne
' and the part, the two statues said they were donated by new ',hp
' ',sp
' next time you re in wellington, watch out for the ',ne
' now i have a to make: before the world cup began i had actually never seen an 
entire soccer game from start to finish ',ne
' the of people would change from day to day, for instance there was a three day
 period where we had over 90,000 in the city, up to their at the hands of german
s ',sp
' then there were the brazilians, everywhere, singing-clapping-dancing-taking pi
ctures, and of course the and brits with their cock-eyed and drinking songs ',hp
' loads of fun ',hp
' i didn t have tickets to any of the games, but my group of friends would alway
s go to a cafe or bar of the that was playing to watch the ',ne
' so to a french cafe for the france-swiss game, a bar when played, drank with t
he brazilians, etc. it was a and hilarious way to take part without fighting the
 ',hp
' another interesting was the that emerged during the cup ',sp
' now this explaining: before the world cup began, if you a german in the street
s, you would probably be called a and at the very least as a radical right ',ne
' and for what it s worth i agree with them, it makes me nervous too ',fr
' so ',ne
' people were genuinely excited about supporting their national team, and taking
 pride in its ',hp
' now this newfound certainly was not shared by everyone ',hp
' and of course no one can an idea better than the germans ',ne
' in june i had also been training at work to lead tours of camp, which i starte
d at the end of the month ',ne
' given the dark history of such a place you can well imagine the of retelling t
hat information, and trying to put it into some kind of historical ',ne
' after a july of beautiful weather and great summer adventures, i traveled with
 my good australian friend to a theater festival in cyprus ',hp
' the was that a good friend of mine from north texas, jessica, was playing the 
title role in medea at a theater festival there ',ne
' now this was ridiculous amounts of fun ',hp
' the city is a sweaty, dirty, hole ',dg
' take your of a squalor-filled mediterranean capital, and add this to your imag
e: 10 story everywhere, in 100 degree heat, all cooled by wall-mounted air condi
tioners, a.k.a. swamp boxes ',ne
' now imagine the from thousands of swamp box coolers on your head as you down t
he streets ',dg
' now add a couple of poorly placed ',ne
' and the city itself really is lovely, in it s own way ',hp
' but two days back to back was more than enough ',ne
' now this was really amazing ',sp
' it took us about two hours to get out there, and then we around and played on 
the rocks for about an hour, taking pics of the old temple ruin that is literall
y clinging to the cliff face ',ne
' and then we watched in with other tourists as the sun went down in front of th
e temple, over the mediterranean ',sp
' the sky is so amazing in greece, it feels like you could really reach up and t
ouch it, it s so close ',sp
' just ',ne
' not bad ',ne
' cyprus was amazing ',sp
' we saw jessica s of medea, and were treated incredibly well by her at the fest
ival ',sp
' we stayed in a tiny mountain village called droushia, and these people brought
 to incredible new ',sp
' they did everything they could to make us feel welcome, everything from puttin
g us up in a beautiful hotel, to let us pay for anything, and making sure that o
ur stay on their was as as the stories always make it out to be ',hp
' tomorrow we ll go somewhere special. ',ne
' the next morning, the last day of the festival, they us all into four drive ve
hicles, and took us off the map to an area that i will henceforth be the blue ',

r, hundreds of long and wide, to the color ',sp

ne
' the time flew by and before i knew it, august was at an end and my was by my b

 a punch in the nuts from phil ',ag
' i asked phil, "what the hell are you doing?" and he looked at me. like i did a

' was i wrong to be taken by that? ',sp
' no ',ne
' i started talking to him about why he was so mad, and he said "you called me r
etarded", and i explained that he was being a prick ',ag

' he "whatever"ed me. ugh ',ag
' i told him he didn t lose me, and he just looked at me and didn t say a word '

' our with family, friends, co-workers etc., all seem to around how crappy are d
ay is, has been, or is going to be, and it seems all like we with one another to
 see who has a one ',dg
' i don t have a plan, i don t know what i want in the long run ',ne
' one day, one week at a time ',ne
' i love my family unconditionally, and cherish every moment with them, even my 
sister, who pushes me over the edge, but i have developed a certain to deal with
 it ',hp
' i have to look at life in her perspective, and it would break heart ',sd
' to have something inside of you that you cannot control, something that has st
olen away your chance of a normal life ',sd
' being alienated, being alone ',sd
' i have a job where i have come to know some amazing people who have such poten
tial, but possibly will never get to put it to any use due to the of the choices
 in life ',sp

' i am happy with a casual, not serious, no relationship ',hp

' hopefully the right one ',ne
' i have a list of things i want to do during my time, and each day i add someth
ing new to it ',ne
' lol, lets just hope i don t run out of time to complete it ',hp
' it says a lot, even if it was written by a comedian ',ne
' i guess i fit the group the article to, in regards to having only 2 or 3 frien
ds that would fall into the "support mechanism" category, if only because of or 
being taken into as well ',ne
' one of those 3 will be moving this fall, and the others have an awful lot goin
g on in their lives, in addition to being less than the first by a long shot any
how ',sd
' i definitely feel like, than any other time in my life, i m operating almost a
t the ground floor in regards to the friendships i have and the way i interact w
ith those friends ',ne
' i ve a lot of bridges and in decisions which have my ability to be as much as 
i d like to be by some of my friends, and likewise, there have been things which
 have my ability to fully engage some people as well, be they or or whatever ',s
d
' we re getting older, we have a lot more work-related matters and our personal 
lives can get pretty complicated ',ne
' on a "big picture" scale, i d like to believe that i still hold the same syste

' all in all, i m satisfied with the bigger picture and angry as fuck at the sma
ller details, but that s what keeps you going, isn t it ',ag
' if i didn t have the desire to be better than what i currently am, would i hav
e to keep living at all ',ne
' as far as "support mechanisms" go, i ve seen what they do to people- at their

y may not have been previously able to reach ',ne
' home may be where you hang your hat, but happiness is sometimes found far from
 home or in the last place you d even to look for it ',hp
' i think sometimes it can be easy to lose track of the idea that happiness and 
are two completely separate and having one does not guarantee or equal having th
e other (some of the time, at least ',hp
' it goes back to that whole journey vs. idea, in that some people only success 
by at a goal, while others are capable of enjoying the efforts required to reach
 that goal as well ',hp
' now which one are you most of the time ',ne
' friendship works the same way- some people only appreciate friendships which a
re and goal-oriented, whereas there are also friendships that along the way, and
 each moment can be as interesting and as the ones before and after ',hp
' i know i m guilty of that all the time ',sd
' often we to realize what we ve lost until something becomes too and difficult 
to ',sd
' old into something that can t be healed, becomes which then becomes amnesia, a

t of paths, but the effort far the of to do so ',dg

' i can only change my own mind, so whatever efforts i have to be met with some 
sort of equal efforts or the process goes nowhere and me the entire way ',dg
' is it worth it, or is it better to just let play out its hand and look for a n
ew deal ',ne
' i guess i do what i can to make the most of what i have, if it s not enough th

' fortunately, my test results came back negative for both gonorrhea and hiv ',h
p
' i was of course thankful, but i realized something very important during that 
time ',hp
' i realized that my life to me. fuck the bullshit ',dg

m this disease and has had it the entire time that we have been friends, but to 
my knowledge has not taken the appropriate care of himself that a person with hi
v should be taking ',ag
' he never took any other than a multi-vitamin ',ne
' when we first became friends he was an athelete, so he was pretty fit for the

' (1600-1750): the era of bach, handel, and saw the of almost every modern in us
e today, particularly the violin, clarinet, and piano ',ne
' composers used counterpoint, dance and repetition in their music ',ne
' think of this brief period as a of all the modern music to follow ',ne
' just kidding ',hp
' you can find nearly all of the most popular composers in this era, and (both o

' 5 ',ne
' composers of this era such as tchaikovsky, brahms, and wrote music with a rang
e, using a variety of ',ne
' 6 ',ne

were writing music than all ',ne
' and anything and everything was possible, from to to ',ne
' over one hundred thousand composers fall into this period, including copland, 
stravinsky, and ',ne
' 7 ',ne
' welcome to the classical period, where we see even more subcategories such as 
the of glass, the electric by john corigliano, and the twelve-tone works of john
 bilotta, a area ',ne
' that was painless, wasn t it ',ne
' your next few into classical music should now be a little easier ',ne
' add a little passion to your life each time you visit, and share my world with
 me ',ne
' arguments in favor: 2 ',ne
' 8 of the "pro" arguments of someone what i take to be every single county in o
regon from which there are no appellate judges ',ne
' there s all of thought about how the measure will make positions more or less 
political, whether those positions already are political, whether it matters tha
t the oregon originally had district elections and to some time ago, whether ele
ctions by district mean that some of the judges will be less than others could h
ave been or whether it means that currently areas (think every area) will have a
 better chance to have someone who them in the appellate courts, etc ',ne
' one of the few that seemed to me to say something worth saying was an argument
 in favor that was written by ron saxton ',ne
' this surprised me, because i know from tv that ron saxton is running for somet
hing or other ',sp
