' Broadcasting this time from the New World ',ne
' Exciting, no ',hp
' So, to the task ',ne
' where did we leave off ',ne
' I ll start my narrative with a little anecdote about how small the world really is. So I was going to work one day, headed to one of the hostels around Berlin to pick people up for the tour, and then bring them back to the Brandenburg Gate where the tour starts ',ne
' As I was preparing to leave, one guy over at the computers yelled out for me to wait, approached me and said hello ',ne
' So he just took his backpack with him and came on my tour ',ne
' We had a great time catching up, and went out that night together as well ',hp
' But it s certainly strange how you randomly run in to people you haven t seen in years, in little hole-in-the-walls in Europe ',sp
' Fun times ',hp
' And this particular piece was by far the best play I have EVER seen ',hp
' It was also incredibly simple, cutting the normally huge cast down to only seven performers ',sp
' It s moments like that that remind me why I ve chosen theatre as a profession ',ne
' I was lucky enough to be able to stay with some friends to cut down on the cost, and see a different side of London life ',hp
' It was sooooo much fun ',hp
' I saw most of the major sites on my own, and I went to the theater almost every night I was there ',ne
' The show was trash ',dg
' Horrible ',dg
' Horribly acted, horribly directed, weak script ',dg
' And interminably long ',dg
' Three hours of horror ',dg
' I wanted to leave at intermission, but my date was really enjoying it (should have been a sign) so we stayed ',hp
' I guess the one good thing I took from it was that I know now that the British are just as capable as we are of producing really awful work ',dg
' While in London I also saw Coriolanus at the Globe Theater ',ne
' Now this was amazing ',sp
' The performers were incredible, and one of the generals was played by Geoffrey, the butler from Fresh Prince of Bellaire ',sp
' That in itself was hilarious, and made us love the show even more ',hp
' I also saw Les Miserables for the first time, and it was fun ',hp
' Loved London ',hp
' Loved the free museums ',hp
' Especially the British Museum ',ne
' Soooo many monuments, including two statues in front of Buckingham Palace that had a conspicuous Communist message ',ne
' Now maybe I was just reading too much into this, or maybe I had spent too much time in the eastern bloc talking about Communist symbolism ',ne
' And the funniest part, the two statues said they were donated by New Zealand ',hp
' Curious ',sp
' next time you re in Wellington, watch out for the Kiwi Commies ',ne
' Now I have a confession to make: before the World Cup began I had actually never seen an entire soccer game from start to finish ',ne
' The hordes of people would change from day to day, for instance there was a three day period where we had over 90,000 Swedes in the city, leading up to their dramatic defeat at the hands of Zeh Germans ',sp
' Then there were the Brazilians, everywhere, singing-clapping-dancing-taking pictures, and of course the pale and pasty Brits with their cock-eyed stares and drinking songs ',hp
' Loads of fun ',hp
' I didn t have tickets to any of the games, but my group of friends would always go to a cafe or bar of the nationality that was playing to watch the match ',ne
' So to a French cafe for the France-Swiss game, a Tapas bar when Spain played, drank Caiprinhas with the passionate Brazilians, etc. It was a colorful and hilarious way to take part without fighting the crowds ',hp
' Another interesting element was the latent patriotism that emerged during the Cup ',sp
' Now this merits explaining: before the World Cup began, if you waved a German flag in the streets, you would probably be called a Nazi and at the very least labeled as a radical right wing nutter ',ne
' And for what it s worth I agree with them, it makes me nervous too ',fr
' So ',ne
' People were genuinely excited about supporting their national team, and taking pride in its accomplishments ',hp
' Now this newfound enthusiasm certainly was not shared by everyone ',hp
' And of course no one can laboriously dissect an idea better than the Germans ',ne
' In June I had also been training at work to lead tours of Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp, which I started at the end of the month ',ne
' Given the dark history of such a place you can well imagine the difficulty of retelling that information, and trying to put it into some kind of historical context ',ne
' After a July of beautiful weather and great summer adventures, I traveled with my good Australian friend Kurt to a theater festival in Cyprus ',hp
' The occasion was that a good friend of mine from North Texas, Jessica, was playing the title role in Medea at a theater festival there ',ne
' Now this was ridiculous amounts of fun ',hp
' The city is a sweaty, dirty, polluted hole ',dg
' Take your impression of a squalor-filled Mediterranean capital, and add this to your image: 10 story apartment buildings everywhere, in 100 degree heat, all cooled by wall-mounted air conditioners, a.k.a. swamp boxes ',ne
' Now imagine the condensation from thousands of swamp box coolers pitter pattering on your head as you stroll down the trashy Athens streets ',dg
' Now add a couple of poorly placed ancient columns ',ne
' And the city itself really is lovely, in it s own way ',hp
' But two days back to back was more than enough ',ne
' Now this was really amazing ',sp
' It took us about two hours to get out there, and then we climbed around and played on the rocks for about an hour, taking pics of the magnificent old temple ruin that is literally clinging to the cliff face ',ne
' And then we watched in amazement with fifty other tourists as the sun went down in front of the temple, over the Mediterranean ',sp
' The sky is so amazing in Greece, it feels like you could really reach up and touch it, it s so close ',sp
' Just FYI ',ne
' Not bad ',ne
' Cyprus was amazing ',sp
' We saw Jessica s production of Medea, and were treated incredibly well by her colleagues at the festival ',sp
' We stayed in a tiny mountain village called Droushia, and these people brought hospitality to incredible new heights ',sp
' They did everything they could to make us feel welcome, everything from putting us up in a beautiful hotel, refusing to let us pay for anything, and making sure that our stay on their island was as enchanting as the stories always make it out to be ',hp
' Tomorrow we ll go somewhere special. ',ne
' The next morning, the last day of the festival, they piled us all into four wheel drive vehicles, and took us off the map to an area that I will henceforth be labeling The Blue Lagoon ',ne
' Imagine the most incredible, horseshoe shaped cove, with unimaginably blue water, and a giant stone underneath the water, hundreds of meters long and wide, adding depth to the color ',sp
' Our hosts had brought along a lunch of fresh fruit and we broke our fast on a cliff overlooking the whole gorgeous expanse ',ne
' It was really interesting staying with them in this little mountain village, and getting to experience a bit of what their culture was all about ',hp
' Oh and the food is incredible ',sp
' But not feta ',ne
' Haloumi has nothing to do with Feta ',ne
' Its really a testament to the vision of the ancients that in our world of skyscrapers and technical gadgetry, we are still fascinated by a two thousand year-old arrangement of stones ',hp
' After returning from Greece my last few weeks in Berlin passed very quickly ',ne
' The time flew by and before I knew it, August was at an end and my doorstep was graced by my best friend Lance, who had come to Berlin for my last week ',ne
' So I spent the next six days in a haze of working my final tours, partying, and showing Lance the city that I had come to love so much over the last two years ',hp
' People say London or Paris is expensive; no ',ne
' But we didn t let that discourage us ',ne
' We had a ball in Zurich ',hp
' We went on a walking tour, went to the City Museum (located in an old castle, very cool), and had a good time relaxing and enjoying the AMAZING views ',hp
' The city is incredibly beautiful, tucked into the Alps and right on the water ',sp
' I think the most important thing I can say about this city, is that all of the rumors: That the city s dirty, the people are rude, the language barrier is insurmountable, the metro is incomprehensible, you things will be stolen, that they hate Americans ',dg
' It s called the city of love and light for a reason ',ne
' The Eiffel Tower is breathtaking, and seeing it in person destroys its cliche and makes you fall in love with the thing ',hp
' The people are absolutely LOVELY ',hp
' We encountered so many genuinely wonderful, helpful, content people ',hp
' Everything from trying to order a baguette in the morning (my Francais is tres terrible) to asking directions or talking to cabbies, we were always pleasantly surprised at how open and welcoming they were ',sp
' And they all seem to really enjoy their city ',hp
' They know how beautiful it is, and they appreciate it ',hp
' And man, it is gorgeous ',hp
' And people are out in them all the time ',ne
' There was a fabulous sense of community there ',hp
' My favorite part about the city parks were the  nap chairs ',hp
' There were people all over the place, and lots of benches and chairs ',ne
' I thought: "that s strange, what s that about? ',sp
' We found out when we headed over to two of these chairs that were situated in the shade, and plopped down ',ne
' We looked around and noticed that there were lots of people all over the park, in the municipal nap chairs, taking a snooze ',ne
' so we did the same ',ne
' What other city would use tax payer dollars to provide napping chairs in a public park ',ne
' Vive la France ',hp
' We really had a ball in Paris ',hp
' We went to Versailles, we went to Notre Dame, and on a fabulous bike tour ',hp
' The most interesting thing we learned on the bike tour was that when the revolutionaries stormed the Bastille, there were only 7 prisoners left in it ',sp
' Montmartre, the old bohemian artist district, five minutes from the Sacre Coeur Cathedral ',ne
' The Cathedral is the highest point in Paris, and from its northerly vantage point, you have the entire city spread out at your feet ',ne
' It s a pretty breathtaking sight ',hp
' On the steps there was always sort of an impromptu party with musicians and performers and other city-watchers gathering with a bottle of wine and a merry spirit ',hp
' Those evenings on the steps are some of my favorite memories from Paris ',hp
' What an incredible end to an incredible journey ',sp
' Thus, is my two year Grande Tour at an end ',ne
' I ve returned ready for a fresh start, collecting new experiences on this side of the pond ',ne
' I was also lucky enough to be hired to direct a show for Frenship high school, which went up last Sunday ',hp
' It was a Commedia dell Arte piece titled The Red Hat, and went extremely well ',hp
' It was a nice way for me to get to stretch those theater muscles and earn a little something at the same time ',hp
' And though my European adventure is over (for the moment) my American one starts tomorrow ',ne
' I m excited about the move, and the opportunities and challenges that await me there ',hp
' There was  a lot to pack in ',ne
' I hope all of you are well; that you have made it through the summer, and are excited about the upcoming (rapidly approaching) holiday season ',hp
' I wish you all a fabulous week, and a warm and safe start to the wintry season ',hp
' All the best till we meet again ',ne
' first day of school ',ne
' My classes all seem fine ',ne
' But math just sucks, and I ve accepted that ',dg

' Our emotions are a gift from God ',ne

' Marshall Rosenberg, author of Nonviolent Communication, has a four-step process for communication that incorporates identifying our feelings and needs into the model ',ne
' Rosenberg also calls this four step process "giraffe language. ',ne
' The heart is about 3 feet long and 3 inches thick all around ',ne
' By stating our feelings and needs to others we avoid blaming and criticizing them ',ag
' We can then go on to making a request instead of a demand to help ourselves satisfy our now recognized need ',ne
' When others are angry or upset with us we can also use this technique on them ',ag
' If we are not correct they will correct us and we will be closer to identifying the need they have and finding a way to resolve the situation ',ne
' We can make a list of these feelings and be on the look out for them ',ne
' For instance, if we feel furious it may be better to take a one hour timeout and calm down ',ag
' Then when we are calm, focus on sharing our feelings and needs with others ',ne
' Many times in the past we have reacted like a lion when we feel angry or frustrated with others or ourselves ',ag

' It s yet another white man insensitivity subject that even has socialists and revolutionaries saying  hey, hold on a second!  ',ne
' Yes, the veils that many Muslim women around the world traditionally wear ',ne
' Listen ',ne
' Let s clarify ',ne
' The veil is often interpreted as being the ninja outfit, where womens heads are completely covered so as to see only the eyes, or in some cases nothing at all ',ne
' This is called the nikab ',ne
' Hijab in Islam actually means modesty or privacy ',ne
' The khimar is the actual headscarf ',ne
' Islam requires women to be modest, henceforth many of them wear the hijab, or headscarf ',ne
' A Fatwa, or Islamic legal pronouncement makes it clear that women are not obliged to wear nikab - but rather this is a cultural issue within more conservative or radical interpretations of Islam (just like the west has some Christian right wackies) ',ne
' It most certainly raised even more anti-Muslim sentiment but also more anti-French sentiment even amongst it own non-Christian communities ',ag
' The Germans have passed similar laws, much to the dismay of its large Turkish-Muslim population ',sd
' The Brits, famous for their true melting pot status amongst the Europeans, have began treading in this murky water ',ne
' Not the ban on hijabs ',ne
' The well integrated, but edgy Muslim community is not so happy about this ',ag
' And I m afraid it could get ugly ',fr
' He clearly stated that he feels the veils should go -- but that it should be over a period of time and from within the Muslim community ',ne
' Not to mention that many Muslim women scholars are saying women should thank Jack Straw for this ',ne
' What i do know is that there are many, many woman who absolutely voluntarily and willingly cover themselves with a headscarf for religious purposes ',ne
' It is also true that many Muslim cultures in the world  oblige  their women to wear the veil ',ne
' France says no head scarves, no nothing -- look like a sexy french school girl with your belly button hanging out ',ne
' Turkey has a similar issue ',ne
' Sarajevo now has a large female Turkish population coming to study here so they can wear what they wish ',ne
' Bosnian Islam is very secular, and indeed seen by most European leaders as a model example of the type of Islam they want being taught in their increasing number of mosques and madressa s within the EU ',ne
' The hijab is accepted and tolerated, as are the nikab wearers (which is an extremely small percentage of Muslim women) ',ne
' The Muslims too have yet to seriously address the fears and concerns of  indigenous  white westerners - who have opened their doors from some of the worlds worst economically and socially oppressed societies ',fr
' This door has to swing both ways ',ne
' Muslims too need to understand the fears and concerns of secular westerners who now have to deal with strict Islamic rules within their own communities ',fr
' If western women can run around half naked, can eastern women completely cover themselves ',ne
' There is no black and white my friends ',ne

' I m EXTREMELY sad to say that it looks as though The Skyline Obscura will be on an indefinate hiatus as of this past Thursday ',sd

' Sheldon and I told him to shut up ',ag

' It s still too soon to make those comments ',ne
' Hell, NEVER make them ',ag
' Because he knew I needed the reaction ',ne
' A couple of times Sheldon would say things to him and he would get angry and tell him to shut up ',ag
' haha ',hp
' I let him slip ',ne
' He didn t want to make eye contact with me, but we made eye contact a lot ',ne
' It was brief, and every single time, we would smile ',hp
' And I didn t try to touch him ',ne
' The whole way there he was grabbing onto poles and screaming like a banshee and his friend Johnny (who came along) got a swift punch in the nuts from Phil ',ag
' I asked Phil, "what the hell are you doing?" and he looked angrily at me. Like I did anything wrong ',ag
' Was I wrong to be taken aback by that? ',sp
' No ',ne
' I started talking to him about why he was so mad, and he said "you called me retarded", and I explained that he was being a prick ',ag
' And he said that since he started drugs, he s a prick ',ag
' And that it s him now ',ne
' He "whatever"ed me. UGH ',ag
' I told him he didn t lose me, and he just looked at me and didn t say a word ',ne
' You just don t show it anymore. ',ne
' Phil walked away quickly ',ne
' They followed, but Daniel took two minutes to look back at me. I was angry ',ag
' My facial expression was beyond hurt ',sd

' ive missed it so ',sd
' the trip was fantastic, plimoth was old and there were real live pilgrims everywhere, salem was cute and adorable but very touristy, ithaca was gorgeous and adorable and joel was there so the whole thing made me very happy and clearly that was the highlight of the trip, niagara was fantastically beautiful but boring once you ve seen the falls, buffalo was sketchy but had great wings and now im home, and i think it s the most wonderful place ive ever been and i dont ever want to leave ',hp
' well, give me two weeks and i ll be out of here but for now, it s good ',hp

' Then, my parents came home and I deicided I d make donoughts ',ne

' I go for my practicum interview next week along with a 2 day orientation at PI ',ne

' I started with one dream, and was working towards it, now I don t see it anymore ',ne
' hey I ll be a rich individual ',hp
' whoot ',hp
' I m really in it just for the money ;) ',hp
' actually I just want to give the opportunity a chance ',ne
' I still will have my degree to back me up and I true desire to go into law enforcement, but for now I want to do this ',ne
' Maybe I have become lazy in thought b/c I don t bother with it ',ne
' Worry gains you no more minutes to  your life ',fr
' and stress ',sd
' we have no one to blame but our selves ',ne
' society has become just one big stress pool ',sd
' Our conversations with family, friends, co-workers etc., all seem to revolve around how crappy are day is, has been, or is going to be, and it seems all like we compete with one another to see who has a crappier one ',dg
' I don t have a plan, I don t know what I want in the long run ',ne
' one day, one week at a time ',ne
' I love my family unconditionally, and cherish every moment with them, even my eldest sister, who pushes me over the edge, but I have developed a certain method inwhich to deal with it ',hp
' I have to look at life in her perspective, and it would break anyones heart ',sd
' To have something inside of you that you cannot control, something foreign that has stolen away your chance of a normal life ',sd
' being alienated, being alone ',sd
' I have a job where I have come to know some amazing people who have such potential, but possibly will never get to put it to any use due to the cirumstances of the choices in life ',sp
' but they make my time at work memorable ',hp
' one I am not thinking long term ',ne
' I am happy with a casual, not serious, no pressure relationship ',hp
' I frankly would be just as happy alone ',hp
' maybe more so ',ne
' They are better off where they are now ',ne
' hopefully the right one ',ne
' I have a list of things I want to do during my time, and each day I add something new to it ',ne
' lol, lets just hope I don t run out of time to complete it ',hp
' it says a lot, even if it was written by a comedian ',ne
' I guess I fit the group the article refers to, in regards to having only 2 or 3 friends that would fall into the "support mechanism" category, if only because of circumstantial or geographical factors being taken into consideration as well ',ne
' One of those 3 will be moving this fall, and the others have an awful lot going on in their lives, in addition to being less available than the first by a long shot anyhow ',sd
' I definitely feel like, moreso than any other time in my life, I m operating almost at the ground floor in regards to the friendships I have and the way I interact with those friends ',ne
' I ve burned a lot of bridges and engaged in decisions which have hampered my ability to be trusted as much as I d like to be by some of my friends, and likewise, there have been things which have altered my ability to fully engage some people as well, be they circumstacial or environmental or whatever ',sd
' We re getting older, we have a lot more work-related matters and our personal lives can get pretty complicated ',ne
' On a "big picture" scale, I d like to believe that I still hold the same value system that I held when I was 18 years old, now a scary half-a-lifetime ago ',fr
' All in all, I m satisfied with the bigger picture and angry as fuck at the smaller details, but that s what keeps you going, isn t it ',ag
' If I didn t have the desire to be better than what I currently am, would I have impetus to keep living at all ',ne
' As far as "support mechanisms" go, I ve seen what they do to people- at their best, they act as a bridge to help people reach things both within and outside themself that they may not have been previously able to reach ',ne
' Home may be where you hang your hat, but happiness is sometimes found far from home or in the last place you d even expect to look for it ',hp
' I think sometimes it can be easy to lose track of the idea that happiness and comfort are two completely separate entities and having one does not guarantee or equal having the other (some of the time, at least ',hp
' It goes back to that whole journey vs. destination idea, in that some people only mark success by arriving at a goal, while others are capable of enjoying the efforts required to reach that goal as well ',hp
' Now which one are you most of the time ',ne
' Friendship works the same way- some people only appreciate friendships which are productive and goal-oriented, whereas there are also friendships that meander along the way, and each moment can be as interesting and rewarding as the ones before and after ',hp
' I know I m guilty of that all the time ',sd
' Often we fail to realize what we ve lost until something becomes too distant and difficult to regain ',sd
' Old wounds fester into something that can t be healed, neglect becomes forgetfulness which then becomes amnesia, and before long you wonder if it ever happened ',sd
' It sucks, and it takes effort to keep a swerving friendship from heading down these sort of paths, but the effort far outweighs the consequences of failing to do so ',dg
' So what does this mean to me then ',ne
' I can only change my own mind, so whatever efforts I expend have to be met with some sort of equal efforts or the process goes nowhere and frustrates me the entire way ',dg
' Is it worth it, or is it better to just let fate play out its  hand and look for a new deal ',ne
' I guess I do what I can to make the most of what I have, if it s not enough then it likely never was, and in that case, at least I know I tried ',ne
' As of late, it seems that everything my parents do, they do it just to annoy me. They re great parents ',ag
' I love them ',hp
' GOD are they annoying me ',ag
' I m not going to go into specifics here, but it almost always ends up in yelling and tears ',ag
' I was thinking about our most recent spat today at dinner and wondering why the hell everything turns out this way ',ag
' My only plausible explanation is that I want out ',ne
' Now, I know that I will reach this place soon enough, but damn it feels like it is taking forever ',ag
' I know its normal for someone who s in college to be living with their parents, but that doesn t quell the wish to be independent and free ',ne

' He s paying $250 a week to eat food, and then eat again ',ne

' no wonder he doesn t have a girlfrend if his definition of more important things than actually looking after yourself like an adult isn t important enough ',ne
' Urgh ',dg
' I think though, what pisses me most off about the food delivery issue - is that he has chosen the easy "I don t have to do anything" option ',ag
' But since he has chosen this option, it s just really irritating me, because he has no concept of a weight problem - he just is lazy ',dg
' He could EASILY cook his own food - his kitchen probably cost more than half my house ',ne

' Sorry for the ranting post, but I m just really annoyed that here I am, struggling with all my internal demons about my weight loss, and someone like this, with no concept of struggle, can just pay someone to lose it for him ',ag

' As we wrote in a recent posting, even in a favorable political climate Democratic candidates face a significant challenge in turning out their base voters ',ne
' Despite widespread dissatisfaction among Democrats with the Bush administration and overall Republican governance, we detect no real signs so far (at least in Harris County) of a groundswell to actually vote in November ',ag
' The argument goes that anger nationally over rising gas prices and health care costs, a protracted, expensive war with no conclusion in sight, and a perception among religious conservatives that George W. Bush has failed to deliver on the social issues that motivate them has taken a toll with GOP base voters ',ag
' Well, maybe ',ne
' As noted in the latest issue of US News &amp; World Report, new polling has Republican insiders feeling pretty darn good about turning out their folks this fall, with confidence that they will vote to return their party s elected officials to power ',hp

' Fortunately, my test results came back negative for both gonorrhea and HIV ',hp
' I was of course thankful, but I realized something very important during that time ',hp
' I realized that my life belongs to me.  Fuck the bullshit ',dg
' The second reason I was pissed was because not only was my friend is dying from this disease and has had it the entire time that we have been friends, but to my knowledge has not taken the appropriate care of himself that a person with HIV should be taking ',ag
' He never took any medications other than a multi-vitamin ',ne
' When we first became friends he was an athelete, so he was pretty fit for the most part ',ne
' Maybe he maintained that lifestyle in the beginning because he thought that  he could somehow combat his illness this way ',ne
' I wonder what changed his mind about that ',sp
' I ve asked him about this, and he has never really given me an answer ',ne

' "The image of cartoonist after cartoonist sitting at folding tables selling comic books is truly a pathetic one ',sd
' It can be ego-crushing when no one comes to buy anything ',sd
' - Bart Beaty, whom I had the pleasure of meeting at the show, from his Conversational Eurocomics column on what SPX could learn from some European convention ',hp
' I really enjoyed myself at SPX, that delightsome Bethesda megamall of rare and exclusive purchases and the men and women who brought the wares about ',hp
' Don t sweat it, that s just my perception: I traveled the hour and a half trip down on Saturday with American Hero Chris Mautner (he attained that storied status by agreeing to drive), arrived a half-hour after the doors opened, stayed until 5:30, then went right back home ',ne
' My SPX, in other words, was full of shopping and stalking the aisles ',ne
' Show debuts ',ne
' I met an awful lot of fine creators, but I hated taking up much of their table time; heaven knows by the afternoon there s a swarm of people waiting to trudge through the byways between tables, and one thousand distractions to attend to ',dg
' There were no signs to direct you to the panels or whatnot, though it wasn t hard to find someone to ask direction of ',ne
' Upstairs there were masses of shoppers with bags and backpacks and totes, cookies and candies and muffins on certain tables to attract attention, and even a pair of folks operating hand puppets to entice a stray passerby ',ne
' All of it in a building off the highway, malls and fences and the whipping metal sea of vehicles all around it ',ne
' It was a hotel, on a road ',ne
' After we passed by a large parking lot promising a furniture blowout sale, as well as a haunted attraction and possibly ponies or something in the back, we decided to turn around and stop at a little diner we d passed on the way ',ne
' We hurried back from the gray highway to the center of comics and people, followed close behind by haunted ponies who d just bought cheap Barcaloungers for their ghost stable and were now jonesing for independent comics ',ne
' I love walking around for things to buy, and traveling less than two hours to arrive at the comics spread of my dreams won t raise too many personal hackles, let me tell you ',hp
' I m also really glad I had Chris with me, since he knew a lot of faces that I didn t; he made a fine guide, though one of us would occasionally wander away from the other in the vein of the old NES version of Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, though I m unsure as to which one of us was Bob Hoskins ',hp
' Actually, I think maybe the best thing about SPX is how everyone is kind of pressed together, comics placed near one another seemingly without much concern for subject matter coherency (I heard it was a bit different in prior years, with multiple selling rooms and all); if the creators in attendance and the books on display weren t a comprehensive picture of English-language non-superhero comics, there was at least enough diversity to manage the illusion of comprehensiveness ',ne
' To look only at this crowd, you d imagine that there was no question as to the diversity of the comics-reading audience ',ne
' There was nowhere to sit in the former, since I got there late, so I sort of drifted in and out of hearing distance ',ne
' Someone behind me turned to someone else and whispered "It s just like Civil War. ',ne
' The Chippendale talk was different, a highly entertaining, digression-prone ramble by the artist through his history and procedure, moderated by Dan Nadel and with extra bonus contributions from Brian Ralph, who was seated in the back of the room ',hp
' Nobody was particularly brusque at SPX, at least from among the artists, but I found Chippendale to be consistently the most emphatic and friendly creator around ',ne
' I tried to follow Tom s rule of not buying anything on my first trip around the room, but that didn t quite hold ',ne

' Welcome to the world of classical music ',ne
' It s my world, a place where music in endless forms and varieties give me an entire lifetime of listening pleasure ',hp
' Since classical music is the oldest and largest genre of music in existence, let s study this music from one era to the next ',ne
' 1 ',ne
' Our first composers were mostly supported by the church (surprise!), and religion influenced early classical music more than any other source ',sp
' There was no formal system of notation, making composing very difficult and time-consuming ',ne
' 2 ',ne
' Music became more of an expressive art than a science, and music was now being printed, allowing sacred, secular, and instrumental music to spread everywhere ',ne
' Claudio Montiverdi was one of the most prominent composers of this era ',ne
' Baroque (1600-1750): The era of Bach, Handel, and Vivaldi saw the development of almost every modern instrument in use today, particularly the violin, clarinet, and piano ',ne
' Composers used counterpoint, dance rhythms and repetition in their music ',ne
' Think of this brief period as a launch platform of all the modern music to follow ',ne
' Just kidding ',hp
' You can find nearly all of the most popular composers in this era, namely Mozart and Beethoven (both of whom didn t know they were writing "classical") ',ne
' 5 ',ne
' Composers of this era such as Tchaikovsky, Brahms, and Chopin wrote music with a wider dynamic range, using a larger variety of instruments ',ne
' 6 ',ne
' New subcategories of classical music were born every year, and more composers were writing music than all previous eras combined ',ne
' And anything and everything was possible, from atonal to experimental to electronic ',ne
' Over one hundred thousand composers fall into this period, including Copland, Stravinsky, and Ravel ',ne
' 7 ',ne
' Welcome to the contemporary classical period, where we see even more subcategories such as the minimalism of Philip Glass, the electric opera by John Corigliano, and the twelve-tone works of John Bilotta, a Bay Area composer ',ne
' That was painless, wasn t it ',ne
' Your next few leaps into classical music should now be a little easier ',ne
' Add a little passion to your life each time you visit, and share my world with me ',ne
' Arguments in favor: 2 ',ne
' 8 of the "pro" arguments consist of someone listing what I take to be every single county in Oregon from which there are no appellate judges ',ne
' There s all kinds of thought about how the measure will make judicial positions more or less political, whether those positions already are political, whether it matters that the Oregon constitution originally had district elections and switched to statewide some time ago, whether elections by district mean that some of the judges will be less qualified than others could have been or whether it means that currently underrepresented areas (think every rural area) will have a better chance to have someone who understands them in the appellate courts, etc ',ne
' One of the few that seemed to me to say something worth saying was an argument in favor that was written by Ron Saxton ',ne
' This surprised me, because I know from TV ads that Ron Saxton is running for something or other ',sp
' The one other somewhat-convincing argument was immediately after that one, also in favor, by an organization of Oregon farmers ',ne
' There seemed to be at least a smidgen of personal experience reflected in that argument, something not really present anywhere else ',ne
' ugh ',dg

' and i held my head there for a while ',ne
' dont worry its not ',ne
' infact i m done ',ne
' nothing else happened in the dream we just cuddled and it was real sweet ',hp
' like wanting to dooo any thing to be with him ',ne
' ok peace ',ne
' Seeing a scarred, bearded man in a rippling black overcoat warmed my heart, because his fingers were painting a trembling solo on his acoustic guitar ',sd
' Eventually, the music faded away, and the guitar slipped back into its bag ',ne
' "Oh," he said, and smiled ',hp
' A few seconds later he turned to me and asked, "Are you going to be here a while? ',ne
' "Ah, thanks. ',ne
' i was very disappointed ',sd
' but i insisted on getting a violin so i took the bus to spirited music and rented one from there ',ne
' i think i m quite good for the amount of time i ve been playing ',ne
' its actually a pretty easy song, i suggest it for all beginers who are really quite sick of playing twinkle twinkle ',ne
' le cygne is usually played on cello, so just bring it an octave up ',ne

' last night me and mike and christina and a bunch of people went to the bar and i got raving drunk on just 2 coolers ',ne
' i suck when im drunk, i just get dizzy and fall asleep, so once i was finished making an idiot of myself at the bar i dozed for hours on mikes couch ',dg
' i wrote a little bit of my book, but not much ',ne
' thats all i m going to mention right now ',ne
' and disgusting ',dg
' I m an avid listener of the programme ',ne
' I love the show because I learn so much ',hp
' Today, though, I heard the commentary of Susan Lee ',ne
' This depends on what you re measuring ',ne
' Markets do not measure everything accurately, and I find this assumption to be disgusting ',dg
' And the Walmartisation of the world changes markets for the worse for labour, making people a mere slot in a computerised schedule, with no regard for their free time ',ag
' Forcing the world into markets is exactly what creates so many problems in the world (*ahem* people are at war with us over it, you know) ',ag
' It is dangerous to force everything into a market mentality ',fr
' It is like throwing everything you eat into a meat grinder ',ne
' Who is going to buy this sort of prediction and  futures  ',ag
' *The ones in control of it* ',ne
' How disgusting would it be to see 9/11 turn into a  market  ',dg
' And who would be the bastard who profits off of the destruction of my workplace and life ',ag
' And, I do ask, who profited from 9/11 in the first place ',ag
' Yes, Ms Lee mentions insurance ',ne
' The answers are dispicable ',dg
' Comment: "Traders, those who buy and sell the contracts, bring all their disparate information on the political situation in Saudi Arabia into this central marketplace ',ne
' Would Ms Lee be throwing out these ideas for the US elections ',ne
' Plus, in such a secretive government, wouldn t this promote corruption ',ag
' The selling of top secret documents to profit off of the killing of 150 people in a mosque ',ag
' And there s really no reason to encourage those who can afford to gamble on this sort of thing to do something so dispicable and amoral ',dg
' It is sickening ',dg
' There is so much room for the worst of humanity in doing things like this, let s not encourage it, please ',dg
' "In the last three years, terrorism has flourished ',ne
' Maybe it isn t ',ne
' I shudder to think ',fr
' Joementum manages to dive on the recent threat-ish that emerged from Britain and turn it all around to make a comment on Ned and the democrats ',fr
' Apparently the extremist terrorists in Britain are connected to the insurgents in Iraq (despite the fact that the former were pure terrorists and the latter are involved in a civil war), and that a slow exit from Iraq was their goal ',ne
' Does no one see the problem with that logic ',ne
' The war in Iraq is fighting terrorists ',ne
' The terrorists want us out of Iraq ',ne
' As long as there are any terrorists anywhere doing anything, we can t pull out ',ne
' All that matters is that terrorists want us out of Iraq, so that means we have to stay ',ne
' The complaint is that we abandoned the search for bin Laden in Afghanistan and went into Iraq under incredibly false premises ',ne
' "I m worried that too many people, both in politics and out, don t appreciate the seriousness of the threat to American security and the evil of the enemy that faces us," Mr. Lieberman said at the Waterbury event ',fr
' He called that threat "more evil, or as evil, as Nazism and probably more dangerous than the Soviet Communists we fought during the long cold war. ',fr
' To suggest that a couple of disorganized idiots trying to replicate Yousef s 1995 plot is more evil and more dangerous than what they did is beyond off-base, beyond stupid ',dg
' It s flat-out disgusting ',dg
' Joe, you re scraping ',ne
' Another apocalyptic vision last night: wandering through large rooms that are stuffy and crowded with people lying on the floor covered with sheets, most of them separate from each other ',fr

' I had never before seen a work by any of the Masters - the closest I have ever gotten to a Michelangelo is watching "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" ',ne
' A real Alma-Tadema ',ne
' Oh, and I think I made the security guards really nervous - like I was going to blow my runny nose on the Renoir and forever ruin it with my bodily fluids ',fr
' They didn t like me very much ',dg
' (Pretty, no? You should see it in person! ',ne
' Like I said, I m no judge of art ',ne
' I was excited to see it as I have a fondness of cadavers (blame Gross Anatomy) and really wanted to get another shot at some up close anatomy viewing ',hp
' Photobucket - Video and Image Hostin ',ne
' A femoralacetabular joint ',ne
' A glenoid-humoral joint.") Some of the exhibits were very interesting, such as  the soccer player and the skateboarder ',hp
' In Gross Anatomy, our cadavers were solemn - laying on the tables as if in a deep slumber ',sd
' Seeing the body in action was very interesting ',hp
' Also interesting were the cases of organs - healthy and diseased ',hp
' The odd thing about Body Worlds is that it goes from being an anatomy exhibit to being a sort of Cadaver Carnival of Bizarre Art ',sp
' Again, I am no judge of art, and the fact that this exhibit has drawn record numbers of people hint at the possibility that I am off-base ',ne
' Now, people can see that organs are not the cartoonish objects that one sees in a book ',ne
' The general public also has a chance to look at diseased organs (something usually reserved for pathologists, who, I ve noticed, seem to get *very* excited over things like polyps and necrosis. ',hp
' The basic anatomy and bodies in motion portions are a must see ',ne
' However, for me, the more "artistic" exhibits were more of a turn off - I willingly admit that I was very attached to my cadaver in Gross, and the thought of him being displayed like that makes me a bit sick ',dg
' As an aside, there have been some interesting articles regarding the aquisition of cadavers for exhibits such as Body Worlds (I guess the entire affair has sparked various "knock-off" exhibits! ',ne
' While this country has access to huge numbers of scientists and medical students (someone has to do the dirty work) there have been some controversies, and questions as to where the cadavers come from ',ne
' However, some of the knock-offs might not be as professional (personally, I d avoid them if I were you. ',ne

' I was able to tell all of the teachers at school that I am pregnant, so it s been fun to hear all of their pregnancy stories ',hp
' Since school is just starting, we ve been eating a lot, and it s funny because they are letting me get away with going first saying I am eating for two ',hp

' Another little check-off on the to-do list, as all three of my summer classes are now done and graded, and I still retain my 4.0 GPA ',ne
' I assume until proven otherwise that I ought to be able to excel at the highest level at most things, so a top grade in all of my classes was always the goal from day 1 ',ne
' Thus, Statistics, mandatory Spanish, and the public speaking class I ve been in this summer were the three classes I ve assumed were most likely to potentially drop my GPA ',fr
