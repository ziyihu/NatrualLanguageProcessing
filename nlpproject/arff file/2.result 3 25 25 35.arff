' A1004AX2J2HXGL	B0007RT9LC	January 17, 2005	9	22	1.0	"Life beyond the thunderdome"	 I cried when I saw The PASSION OF THE CHRIST - how could you not? I sat there and watched a man brutalized for two hours. Everyone around me was crying - it felt like we were all tuned in to the proceedings of a televised execution.  I was a little confused by the time it was all over & as I was leaving the theater, I was even more so: I saw parents walking out with their children.  Jesus Christs teachings were left in the wings, the significance of his life locked out of the script almost entirely.  Hardly a first impression for young children.  The ONLY things I found at all interesting about the PASSION OF THE CHRIST: the use of the authentic languages from the time period (Latin & Aramaic) and the actors bringing this movie to life.  James Caviezels performance in Terrence Malicks THE THIN RED LINE was simply mesmerizing, and he used a similar pallet of emotion for his performance here.  I was raised a Roman Catholic - so viewing the Stations of the Cross was nothing new to me.  To suggest this film version of that seasonal meditation is a "masterwork" - simply is absurd.  So what WAS the point of this film, what were we to draw from its brutal imagery?  There was no inspiration in Mel Gibsons film for me, no arc of understanding - only suffering and death.  Which led me to consider their goal may have been to create a vivid emotional experience, intended to lift us out of numbness and inspire reflection on faith to get us through this life: televised warfare, beheadings on the internet, stories of sickness and shootings on the nightly news, etc.  Perhaps, but I dont think so.  A fleeting, knee-jerk reaction with some tears shed on queue, and then those emotions are safely placed back on the shelf until the next time.  Complicity and silence have always gone hand in hand: its easy to damn this world, condemn what we see as different from our own huddled beliefs; allow selfishness and insincerity to decimate through clouds of frankincense and joyous hymns.  Salvation?  Maybe.      The infamous THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST, directed by Martin Scorsese, is a "masterwork" of filmmaking. The film not only inspires the heart, but also prods the mind.  I could feel the breath of those images, allowing me to enter the world it created and truly feel something more than myself.  It was not an epiphany; it was a fresh view, it was an enlightened dream of another world, yet strangely our own.  The film didnt plague the audience with blood and horrors; it dramatizes the passion and relevance of the story.  Ive come to understand and believe Jesus Christ to be among the greatest teachers this world has known, who suffered the tortures of the damned to inspire his vision of peace, determination for truth and humility in us all - ideals that have taken a back seat to robotic, indignant servitude to skewed "moral" interests.    The LAST TEMPTATION was based on the book by Nikos Kazantzakis - from which the filmmakers created a thoughtful, passionate re-examination of one of the greatest stories ever told.  Mr. Scorsese, in his youth, had almost joined the priesthood; but chose to explore and express his passion through the cinema.  I saw no blasphemy in his images - only a powerful film exploring faith in ourselves and the world.  Often cited as trash, garbage and against popular faith - this film truly offers a story of FAITH we can all profit from, regardless of what we believe.        ',spam
' A1004AX2J2HXGL	B00062IVM6	January 17, 2005	4	7	5.0	Im making my lunch!	 WILD AT HEART on DVD.  Ive been waiting on this day for a long, long, long time.    The first time I saw this movie, I was floored.  Few movies excel in creating such an atmosphere of heat and humid drama on screen so well (DO THE RIGHT THING & STRAY DOG come to mind).  Mr. Lynch brings the raw, kinetic lives of Barry Giffords characters to the screen in his own particular way & everything about this movie just screams rock and roll and dangerous things.  The design of the film recalls elements of film noir, motorcycle and B-movies from the fifties and even a dusting of the gritty seventies.  As for the cast?  Diane Ladd can wear puke & fly on a broomstick with sparkling brilliance.  Harry Dean Stanton aint nothin but a hound dog; Willem Dafoe, rivaled only by Dennis Hopper, draws a wicked flame of evil as Bobby Peru - his scene with Laura Dern is incredible; Nicolas Cage channels alot of the same power that E had & Laura Dern fills her red ruby slippers with a delicious, trailer trash sweetness.  Marcello Santos, Drop Shadow, Reggie, Mr. Reindeer, Uncle Pooch - characters all, shipwrecked on planet Earth.  If you enjoy film noir, trashy romances - then say no more - this is just the one for you.  The DVD transfer looks spectacular, the extras are juicy and the only thing lacking would be a commentary track, I guess.  But the movie is certainly good enough to speak for itself.    OK - in reference to another reviewer (ixta coytl) - David Lynch guilty of plagiarism?  A dog with a hand in its mouth is most certainly, most definitely taken from YOJIMBO.  So what, it doesnt warrant "borderline plagiarism"?  At the end of GOODFELLAS, the very last image of Joe Pesci shooting at the screen is taken from a silent film called THE GREAT TRAIN ROBBERY (Edwin S. Porter).  GOODFELLAS is now an imitation of that film?  Artists borrow and steal from each other constantly; the above examples are hardly suggesting plagiarism.  Also, checking your characters into a motel isnt grounds for plagiarism either - even if it is from the great TOUCH OF EVIL.  The "seedy motel" has a long tradition in films that fall under the genres of film noir, southern gothic or the classic road movie.  Everyone needs to stop somewhere for the night sooner or later.    So, keep on kickin (...) on the dance floor & tellin EVERYONE whats on your almost perfect mind...       ',spam
' A1004AX2J2HXGL	B00064LJVE	January 13, 2005	5	15	1.0	Into the woods	 M. is a hack, a second-place magician in a high school talent show.  Hes drawn comparisons to Hitchcock and Spielberg - in the same sentence no less?  Resting on the laurels of exactly ONE good movie, he manages to eek out a career for himself.  Since THE SIXTH SENSE, his movies have gotten progressively worse.  UNBREAKABLE was fair at best.  An interesting idea with a dull, rumbling ride to the conclusion.  SIGNS was a very rough movie to watch.  The characters were cookie-cutter samples of human emotion and conflict - toss in a guy in an alien suit and you have what exactly?  A bad joke.  Now, THE VILLAGE...    Mr. Shyamalans "entertainments" are about as mediocre as you can get - and I really do wish I could enjoy his movies.  They seem to lack something.  Walking out of this one, I felt like I had just witnessed a badly executed parlor trick disguised as a vague "social commentary" piece.  Bryce Howard is a wonderful actress; I hope to see more of her in the future.  She takes a lifeless character and gives her depth.  The other cast members also played their parts wonderfully - too bad it wasnt another movie.  The trailer seemed creepy; a dark fairytale or ghost story set in the 19th century.  Nice idea, havent seen one of those in a while.  I pay the eight bucks, and watched this thing unfold:   THE VILLAGE had absolutely no suspense, no tension - a few cheap scares along the way - but nothing to make the "trick" ending worth the ride.  I wont give it away for those who havent seen the movie, but the whole story is so flat and badly contrived, that it doesnt really matter.  The pay off was in the vein of the "Twilight Zone" & when it was revealed, I could almost hear the squeaky curtain and see the wizard furiously working the controls to an out-of-control smoke machine.  Im not looking for depth or stories that cleverly draw an allegory of our world every time I go to the movies, but would like something above... this?  Pretty cinematography, composition and cheap thrills do NOT make good movies - that would be like having a handsome nose with loose teeth and no eyeballs.    I read a review that stated this movie was "smart... an intelligent thrill-ride".  No it wasnt - it was awful rubbish.  And reading some of the other reviews here, I get the impression theyd enjoy watching chocolate balls melt in their hand... or its completely possible I saw another movie with the same title and premise?   A twisted ending, to be sure.                  ',spam

It is so obvious shes about as real an artist as her sister (rich & dumb Jessica Simpson-Lachey).  The music is so vapid, phoney and devoid of any real content; the lyrics remind me of love notes scribbled on the back of a trapper keeper. I enjoy great, entertaining music like the next person - but this stuff just insults the intelligence.    Come on now?  Why cant people get behind real artists, people with actual talent and interesting things to say?  Not talking depth, but just plain reality?  Its disheartening, one, that this is the kind of stuff the industry seems to always get behind - cash cow potential;  but on the other hand, people buy up this rubbish?  This seems to be one of the hoofprints of our culture: toss anything into the troth and we eat it up.  Maybe it really doesnt matter in the end.  Life is short, so who cares?

' A1004AX2J2HXGL	B00019RD1Y	December 20, 2004	1	1	5.0	Exceptional music that can stand alone as brilliant works	 A wonderful, wonderful collection of music.  I always loved the music for both SATYRICON and FELLINI ROMA - to have them available on CD is a treasure beyond belief!  Ive always been dissatisfied with only the two minute suites previously available on other Fellini/Rota score collections.  SATYRICONs music definitely creates an other-worldly quality.  Ethereal music that stands up well on its own; seeming more at home in a science fiction film, rather than an exploration Romes decadence.  In places, you can hear crackles, as if the recording was taken off an LP.  But this is not distracting at all; in fact it seems to enhance the distant mood of the music.        FELLINI ROMA is marvelous!  The score is more ambient and moody, less variant than SATYRICON; however, it creates a dark, dream-like ambiance incomparable to most soundtracks.  The music for the Catholic fashion show is strangely upbeat, very much like the organ music heard in most Roman Catholic churches.    TOBY DAMMIT is the most standard of the three.  It is an amazing work - and one in a long line of film music that is evidence enough of Nino Rotas haunting musical genius.  Playful and dark, it works very well to build and sustain the mood that Fellini intended for the film.  Highly recommended for avid listeners of film music.      ',spam
' A1004AX2J2HXGL	B00003CXHM	April 9, 2004	1	1	4.0	"drunken prophecies, libels and dreams"	 Wow.  The Sex Pistols?  Never heard a more perfect name for a band.  Immediately conjures up all sorts of images.  Then seeing photographs of the band and the environment they spawned: like walking into a cultural junk shop and finding some wild, interesting things.  Then you hear the music, and you KNOW that things will be all right.  The documentary was like watching a wildly painted, gravelly sounding, busted-up auto running laps around the neighborhood grandstand.  I sat on the couch, popcorn and soda handy - and watched this documentary twice in one night.   Memories of this sort are like a giant bonfire that everyone throws logs on to keep it going.  For the first time, the Pistols toss there own logs onto the fire.  Just the thought of the backdrops, colors and possibilities attached to that time and place are wondrous enough.  It seemed so open, raunchy and ugly that you can run a million scenarios in your head and still have room for more.  The Sex Pistols were at the apex of all this: an accident, a force of nature.   The title alone, THE FILTH AND THE FURY, suggests so much about what you are about to experience.  You are told a story in a chaotic manner, images hurled at you - grainy, black and white concert footage; crazy, young English kids acting like they just dont care; seedy bars, streets and garbage dumps; representatives of various government, media and church organizations.  Lots of news reels and garish lights.  The surviving band members tell their own versions of what happened; their faces cast in shadow to keep you carefully tuned in to the images of the time period.  Essentially a history lesson taught by the people who created, and were created by, the moment.  I thought it was well done - but left me wanting more. But that was OK, too.  Their career was so abrupt, 26 months from start to end - which I think has much to do with interest in them to this day.       "High drama" as John Lydon describes it - is exactly it.  Everything suggested by the Sex Pistols, all the random images and brilliant simplicity of the music just feeds the imagination.  You cant create that kind of magic with high gloss and untouchable superstars.  For my money, Steve Jones was the best interview in the whole thing.  The guy is hilarious!  He seems like someone youd hang out with for hours and hours at a bar, drinking beers and exchanging war stories.  The commentary by Julien Temple is extremely dull and doesnt add much.  The other punk documentary, if it serves any purpose at all, illustrates where they could have gone wrong in the making of THE FILTH AND THE FURY.  So, you may want to rent first, but youll probably want to pick up a copy for yourself.  It doesnt wear thin with repeat viewings.      ',nonspam
' A1004AX2J2HXGL	B000059H9C	January 25, 2004	3	3	5.0	roasted pigs in space!	 FELLINI SATYRICON - the first film I experienced directed by Federico Fellini.  I was with two or three other people in a small theater, and remember sitting through the movie with my jaw gaping like a little kid watching cartoons; I was on the edge of my seat.  I walked out and spent an hour or so trying to figure out what the hell it was I just saw?  Favorite scenes: Vernacchio, marriage at sea, minotaur.  I later read that Fellini had always wanted to make a science fiction picture, and SATYRICON was the closest he would come to that goal.  Petronious Arbiter was a Roman scholar and poet who mixed with the courtesans of the emperor Nero.  The remains of his writings are his observations of the world he lived; ultimately, he was "asked" by Nero to end his own life for various insults to the emperor.  A strange, distant world is painted in the fractured remains of the Satyricon.  Fellini used the text as a jumping off point to attempt to imagine a world completely alien to our own (images, sound, everything).  Fueling this tour-de-force of invention is the period of the films creation - the late sixties.  If not directly quoted in its scenes, the spirit and free form of the late sixties definitely influenced Fellini and company.  BARBARELLA comes to mind as a comparison, in terms of color pallet, bizarre situations and a comic book quality - psychedelia at its finest.  Fellinis interpretation of the Satyricon seems to capture that weird pulse of chaos and the "climate" of revolution; stripping away a mere "classic literature travelogue" approach - and presenting a libidinal sideshow of monsters, perverts, politicians, artists, and other variations of the human condition.  The movie works like a dream, just presenting this river of existence that we follow through the misadventures of the main characters: Encolpio, Ascilto and Gitone.  Its certainly a wonderful work of art and invention, among the best the cinema has provided thus far.  Since its release, major filmmakers have dipped into this film for inspiration - Terry Gilliam, George Lucas, Martin Scorsese, etc.   In the end, Encolpios desperate way of life leaves nothing behind, except an expressionless face carved in stone amongst other faces.  Life is short and fleeting.  What will people two thousand years from now think of the way we live today?  Trying to imagine a possible inkling of an idea to follow that question was all I could think about after walking out of FELLINI SATYRICON.   So, Im not sure what youd call this movie - science fiction?  A comedy?  CALIGULA on acid?  I read [maybe in Playboy] that Fellini was asked to direct CALIGULA, and refused to take the job.  Funny, that.  Certainly SATYRICON is an entertainment of some kind?  Whatever it is - definitely RENT it first.      ',spam
' A1004AX2J2HXGL	B00000153R	December 21, 2003	3	3	5.0	nervous man with a four dollar CD	 I recently bought this CD brand new.  I knew that it has gone out of print - so put down my other selections and bought this in case I never come across it again at the ridiculous price of four dollars (and change)!  Im a fan of the original series; I watch it whenever its on the Sci-Fi Channel.  I was surprised to find this compilation in a local record store?  I was driving home with it in my CD player; the snow was falling, cars passing in and out of the darkness... The music on this CD succeeds in getting under your skin and makes the banal things in life more sinister, more disturbing.  I dont have the show deep enough in my brain to recall scenes as I listen to the music - so in that respect, the music becomes creepier, attaching itself to life around as I listen to it.  Kind of putting me in my own twilight zone, and thats OK.   I highly recommend this collection - if you can find it?      ',nonspam
' A1004AX2J2HXGL	B00003CXE7	December 19, 2003	5	25	1.0	Meditations?	 This movie was lots of fun. The story was so gritty and affecting. I remember after watching it for the first time, I made my own sword from scrap wood & laid into some mailboxes and windshields.  Ancient Rome burned in my heart.  GLADIATOR charges the blood with electricity. The characters are so compelling, deep and human. The villain, played to perfection by Joaquin Phoenix, was pure brilliance.  Russell Crowe dips his hand into the gritty Earth and produces a hero of uncommon, brutal honesty.  The lions, the vicious cheers of a blood-thirsty crowd...  I give this movie exactly ONE STAR.  The story, even for an epic, was compelling for a grand total of five minutes.  The plot blunders predictably along, creating little or no emotional momentum & absolutely no sense of adventure.  Kids in a sandbox could contrive a better story than this piece of garbage.  About an hour into this vacuum, I just wanted Russell Crowe to kill Commodus so I could get back to my life.    Joaquin Phoenix "vexed" me with his paper thin performance as the twisted, impotent usurper.  Perhaps Phoenix cant be blamed for the job he turned in?  They gave him such a narrow, cardboard role to play - a weak foil to the driven, fertile, masculine Maximus.  There was no descent into madness; something vaguely human that would have at least given some dimension to this silly story.    Ridley Scott created a beautiful film.  The cinematography was masterful - like a crazy European car commercial.  A wild, powerful sports car rolls into the coliseum, everyone stops their torturous acting & begins to feel the fine interiors, check under the hood, blare some music and then comment on the trunk space.  Maybe a quick ride to showcase the vehicles performance?  A lion could sit on the hood and roar a little bit - an obvious appeal to the grunting desire to identify with virility and power that lurks in all of us.  Oh well.  The mass appeal of this bore was a clear demonstration of the famous quote: "a sucker is born every minute."         ',spam
' A1004AX2J2HXGL	0691008752	December 18, 2003	8	8	4.0	"Please open your books to page one..."	 Ive been a fanatic over Federicos work since I first saw FELLINI ROMA in a classroom one Friday night in college.  I came across a poster advertising the scheduled screening; it was an image from one of the last, most unsettling scenes in the film - a very Catholic fashion show.  My interest was piqued enough to spend an evening in a classroom rather than other social pursuits; and what a classroom it was.  I was one of maybe three people in the room that night.  I cant explain in words what I saw on the screen - it was simply incredible.  It felt like my world opened a little bit more; my own dreams and ideas didnt seem quite so ridiculous. I started to hunt down other films by this director, reading articles, reviews, anything.  I eventually came across Mr. Bondanellas book, and found it to be a wonderful companion piece to the work of Fellini.  It reads like a textbook, but his incites into the craft and visions of Fellini are wonderful.  That said, I didnt take his interpretations as gospel - this book provides an excellent jumping off point into understanding Fellinis world - the fantasies and the world that inspired them.     I recommend this book highly to fans of Fellini and students of film in general - a fantastic document.  It attempts, and I think succeeds, to capture the story of a rare kind of brilliance.

' A1004AX2J2HXGL	0783228473	December 4, 2003	1	1	5.0	This fish keeps swimmin in a jar	 RUMBLE FISH.  I absolutely love this movie.  Ive read many times about how pretentious and over stylized this is?  Who cares!  Filmmaking isnt always about reproducing reality and making safe, digestible movies for the popcorn public?  A little iconoclasm never hurt anyone.  The movie gets its story across in a superb fashion - creatively and passionately.  In the hands of another production crew, we would have had a lame "movie of the week".  They took a risk with stark, darkly crafted images, German expressionistic set pieces and camera angles and a pulsating soundtrack and score.  Everything feels OFF to the viewer, maybe even forced - because the idea is Rusty James is trying to be like his brother, live in the world of his brother.  But life continues to bang at the door; its mystery seeping through the cracks of the claustrophobic existence he is surviving from day to day.  He needs to discover the world on his own terms.    The production of RUMBLE FISH flew under the radar, much like another brilliant film distributed by Universal Pictures: REPO MAN.  Both movies address the same subject matter from two wildly different styles and points-of-view.  Rusty James and Otto Maddox are definitely kindred spirits in the stories told through them.  The cast of RUMBLE FISH is fantastic: Dennis Hopper is terrific as the alcoholic father, Matt Dillon is a natural, Mickey Rourke in his best role, Diane Lane is stunning, Vincent Spano brings STEVE to life and Nicolas Cages hair in this film is way too much.  Also, Stewart Copelands music works perfectly within the film, and is just as strong on its own.  However, the current DVD edition stinks to high heaven.  Period.  Horribly mastered sound and image.  No extras to speak of?  We get a trailer and those silly PRODUCTION NOTES - in which we have to scroll through on the television.  Awful.  In a case like this, I wish that the CRITERION COLLECTION group would take a look at this one and consider going to work on it.  Otherwise, well have to be satisfied it was released at all for our buying pleasure.      ',spam
' A1004AX2J2HXGL	B00003CWPL	December 2, 2003	111	125	5.0	"But what the hell do they know, I said?"	 If youre reading this, then youve seen this movie or are at least curious what all the hype is about?    The late Stanley Kubrick, the only major filmmaker Lynch has cited as a direct cinematic influence, believed that ERASERHEAD was one of the most perfect "cinematic experiences" created to date.  This movie has enjoyed success on the midnight movie circuit for years, particularly in NYC where it ran almost every night for something like five years straight. Ive seen it on big and little screens in three different states.  Insofar as interpretations are concerned, Ive long since tossed all that out the window.  In terms of rational comprehension, ERASERHEAD is the fabled big fish that remains brilliantly elusive of any attempts to capture it.     This movie gets better, and more humorous, every time I watch it: in my opinion - ERASERHEAD is the cinematic experience that comes the closest to capturing "dream logic", next to the equally brilliant WAKING LIFE.  If you ever get the chance, watch ERASERHEAD in a movie theater with a great sound system - you will understand why Stanley Kubrick was moved enough to make his statement.  Its like experiencing someone elses dream - the ultimate act of voyeurism?  As if I was granted audience to a demonstration of delicate brain surgery, and catching glimpses of the patients face throughout the operation (particularly the opening scene).  It creates such a visceral landscape with its dark, peculiar selections of image and sound, that it seems to be constantly reminding you that the "soul" is helplessly sloshing around somewhere inside an organic bag of blood, bone, hair follicles, industrial shrapnel, dirt piles and antique radiators; a terrifying and beautiful delineation of a living creature suddenly made aware of its own being (birth imagery abounding).  It is a perfect symphony of sound and image, amazing work for a first time feature film director!  Ive seen this movie placed in the HORROR section at local video stores; its better suited for the COMEDY section, I fear.  The movie was created on the AFI campus in California; production beginning his last year there, and continuing on for several more years in secret.  Not for everyone, but certainly worth a peek.    I own a copy of ERASERHEAD on DVD, finally.  It is available at David Lynchs website for forty-five bucks plus shipping and handling.  Remastered sound and image, includes a few extras - the standout is a "stylized" interview with Lynch about the making of the film, the characters involved and anecdotes.    BTW - where is WILD AT HEART and LOST HIGHWAY for our DVD pleasure?      ',spam
' A1004AX2J2HXGL	B000077VQC	October 19, 2003	13	13	5.0	God save the Sex Pistols!	 This is a fantastic DVD for any longtime fan of the SEX PISTOLS, anyone curious about the beginnings of English "punk" or anyone just passionate about rock music.  We are treated to candid and relaxed interviews with the important characters involved in bringing this great album to life.   I think this makes a great companion documentary to THE FILTH AND THE FURY; a fine documentary, kind of using the anti-gloss, cut-up approach for highlighting the influences, the rise, the fall and impact of the SEX PISTOLS.  For me, NEVER MIND THE BOLLOCKS has never grown old, the music brilliantly simple.  In addition, knowing the history of the band, it makes the music that much richer.  On this documentary - John Lydon speaks fondly to the comic, almost camp feel at the heart of this album.  Steve Jones laments that if they hadnt kicked Glen out, if they didnt do the Bill Grundy show - there may have been more albums from the SEX PISTOLS.     The bonus material is simply stuff that was excised from the main event of this DVD, because it strays away from the subject of the album itself.  It is possible this was originally aired as a series on television, and they had to trim everything for interest of time?  Whatever the case, I wish they just presented it as a whole - all included.  The bonus material can only be viewed section by section, and that can get tiring after a while.  Not a major complaint, really.   Im glad I bought this DVD; it provides a fresh view to a notoriously underrated band.  I recommend it highly.      ',spam
' A1004AX2J2HXGL	B000005X1J	October 17, 2003	41	44	4.0	The cult of personality!	 Charles Manson.  The name says it all.  You drop the name on anyone, and the reactions will all be the same for the most part.  In addition to the notorious stories recalling the events of 1969 - I always think of Axl Rose wearing the KILL YOUR IDOLS shirt with the famous image of the wild-eyed cult leader.  Charles Manson?  His life is somewhat documented - born to a prostitute and living amongst the shadows of humanity in the streets.  I dont know for sure if he was a genius, more like a very particular breed of person.  Maybe for lack of understanding, he is called a "genius" in the same breath as a "monster".  The fascination with him probably runs along the same lines as the likes of Ed Gein, Jack the Ripper and Ted Bundy.  There is something about these people that operate on very primal levels, parts of the psyche best left buried far beneath culture and civilization? I bought this CD out of curiosity.  I wanted to know what a guy with this kind of mind writes songs about.  What I found was very unexpected to say the least - a voice full of expression, and lyrics that were as spare and direct as the music itself.  A folk-singer from the darkest corners of the American experience, these recordings were completed prior to the events that would make him an icon of sorts.  Just looking over the song titles, you start to see the fragments of a mystery.  I remember hearing an interview with CM, where he states he has been in prison all his life.  And he sings about just that.    Ive had a few friends of mine listen to the CD without letting them in on who the artist was.  I heard some interesting guesses: Willie Nelson, Hank Williams, James Taylor and even John Phillips.  They all confessed to actually liking what they heard, and then expressed guilt for actually liking it!  I like it.  I think theres much added to it by the notoriety of the artist - but all in all, not bad music.  Theres certainly a rock-gut sincerity here that elevates it above the normal love, tongue-in-cheek, beatnik styles of folk music popular at the time - providing a counter-point to popular styles, even.   I wonder what direction his career would have taken if he was actually signed to a label and promoted: would he have gone all that far anyway?  He doesnt seem like the type of guy that would really bend to the wills of record executives and marketing agents.  Maybe we would have had "punk" a little sooner than later?  Maybe he would have fizzled around 1972, and then get arrested for shoplifting dresses in Florida a few years later?  Lots of maybes.

The music he left us just has that feel of someone who has traveled the humid shadows of the early twentieth century, checked into every dive hotel and motel across the Bible belt, stomped his feet in more than a few juke joints, courted the devil and let everyone know about it, smoked a few cigarettes, drank his share liquor, tasted love and was bitten more than once.  The more you listen, the more your imagination is sparked.   This particular collection showcases the 29 songs he recorded - minus the variations.  If you are a casual listener, this is a marvelous retrospective of the music.  If you are more of a completist, then the critically acclaimed box set is what you want.  To be honest, Im not a big fan of the blues - in all its various styles.  A few things I like are R.L. BURNSIDE - TOO BAD JIM, JIMI HENDRIX - BLUES and various things from MUDDY WATERS, SON HOUSE and HUDDIE LEDBETTER.  A quote from the CD liner notes by Tony Watts: "If details of Robert Johnsons life are shadowy, there is nothing at all indistinct about his music which is full of the most elemental power imaginable.  Obviously a driven man, he attempted to exorcise his demons through the medium of his songs..."  I sometimes wonder if its because this guy left so few facts about his life behind, that his music becomes that much better?  The popular story of his lifes end is he was poisoned by a jealous husband he had cuckolded, and then buried in an unmarked grave after midnight.  The king is gone but hes not forgotten:  Does the mystery and drama of his short life actually float the music, add to its potency and make it transcendent above what it actually is?  My recommendation is to take a listen for yourself.  For whatever the reason, I cant stop listening to this collection of great songs.  Personal favorites are - HELLHOUND ON MY TRAIL, MALTED MILK, LITTLE QUEEN OF SPADES, IF I HAD POSESSION OVER JUDGEMENT DAY, FROM FOUR `TIL LATE and STOP BREAKIN DOWN BLUES.  Enjoy.      ',spam
' A1004AX2J2HXGL	B000002P4L	October 15, 2003	8	8	5.0	Hypnotic pulse of exotic places east?	 One evening, my friends and I were witnesses to the belly dancers art in full swing at a local Middle Eastern place.  I always had an idea of what it was like - but the reality was amazing.  It took me away to another time and place.  The music seemed to sweep her around the room like a whisp of seductive smoke and bells.  The belly dancer later told me she usually works with tracks off DIASPORA, in addition to other artists.  The title is a word that refers to Jews living outside the promised land - the dispersed, essentially. Ive heard most of Natacha Atlas music - and will state flat out this is her best, most hypnotic album.  HALIM is my second favorite - and the rest kind of fade out from there.  An artist does what an artist does:  she apparently is moving towards the R&B and hip-hop genres that are popular in the United States and Europe.  Not sure why?  She may be trying to cut her teeth in these styles and try to make a bigger break?  How unfortunate.  If you listen to samples of her later albums, you will know what Im describing.  Sounds like the junk I hear on European variety shows and MTV.  Wherever her career has been moving toward: DIASPORA is still simply magic - very refreshing, full of a sensual and erotic life all its own.  I wish that Natacha would return to this more traditional style, but alas she has seen the future and it will be... Get DIASPORA and be whisked away.  If you have a work out schedule, enjoy cheesey house music or third-rate hip-hop, then by all means explore her other efforts.  I will stop here, thank you very much.  I had to purchase a USED COPY of this album, as it is now unfortunately OUT OF PRINT.      ',spam
' A1004AX2J2HXGL	B00000K19E	October 13, 2003	2	5	2.0	Morpheus and Neos Excellent Adventure	 Whats all the ballyhoo about?  Genre defining?  Maybe if the genre was SUCK.  How could 50,000 [MATRIX] fans be wrong?  For every reason in the book.  I guess you have to be hooked up to a hoover vacuum cleaner to really enjoy this useless, dead-fly-on-the-sill, dust-ball-in-the-corner, two-year-old-christmas-tinsel of a movie.  I can just hear one of the ten-thousand copies of THE MATRIX video talking to me as I pass it by in the local rental store, "Why do you hate me?  Why dont you just simmer down..." First of all, Keanu Reeves is about as wooden an actor as you can get.  Even Mark Hamill had some depth playing an everyman, blank slate of an action hero who takes a similar archetypal journey.  Im just surprised Keanu had brains enough to take the correct pill so this shinola-load of a plot could continue.  But I digress?  Larry "Laurence" Fishburne plays his part like hes recording a books-on-tape version of SENSE AND SENSIBILITY.  Im surprised, because he worked out so well in SCHOOL DAZE and APOCALYPSE NOW.  But I cant fault the actors really, they were handed this shlock of a script to a movie which has every yo-yo thinking they are better off somehow for having experienced this?  I guess this flick is about as challenging, mentally, as that other over-rated junkpile GLADIATOR.  Does all this cheap philosophy really get the brain tumors worked up?  Its like dropping a shiney object in a pond and watching all the fish clamor after it.  This movie was actually pretty bland and full of holes if you remove the special effects.  I found the references to ALICE IN WONDERLAND heavy-handed and cheesey.  I love ALICE IN WONDERLAND and recommend sitting down to read that book as an alternative to viewing this snooze of a movie.  I was surprised they didnt use the Jefferson Airplane song WHITE RABBIT - or at least have a techno-monstrosity version of it?  Maybe they did and I was too zoned out of boredom to notice.   "Wow, we are really in an faux-reality controlled by the very machines we created?  Sheesh - you dont say?  Better roll out some special effects to put a hurtin to these roving mongoloid footballs..."  THE ORACLE should have tried cooking up some fried eggs, because the cast was certainly wearing it on their faces.  I guess the only redeeming ounce of quality in this thing was the certifiably cool robo-villain, AGENT SMITH.  I was amazed by him - he was like a DEVO record actualized.  Stomping, in his own special Agent Smith way, on the skulls of our thinly drawn heroes.  I imagined Agent Smith wearing a huge DELETE button around his neck, erasing this movie as he went along.  Then, there were so many of him in the sequel MATRIX RELOADED - THE SEARCH FOR MORE MONEY, I felt certain at least one of the Agent Smiths would have a DELETE button stowed away in his breast pocket?  That would have been worth the eight bucks.  But now Im obviously getting into SPACEBALLS territory.  I couldnt get this far without offering some alternative selections to cure a paying audience of this infection, now could I?  For starters: in addition to SPACEBALLS, 2001: A SPACE ODYESSEY, EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, BLADERUNNER, ALIEN(S), TOTAL RECALL, STARSHIP TROOPERS, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, MARS ATTACKS, 12 MONKEYS, THE THING, THEY LIVE!, TIME BANDITS, THX-1138, ENEMY MINE, PREDATOR and ROBOCOP - I offer the darkly brilliant DARK CITY.  Yes, this movie will be observed as slow and boring by the five star gushers here; but in terms of originality, vibrance, and just plain storytelling know-how -  well it leaves THE MATRIX slithering in the dust.  DARK CITY was like Alfred Hitchcock had returned from his deep carbon freeze, slipped on a pair of nice fitting SCI-FI shoes and went to bat for us one more time. So, to answer the video copy of THE MATRIX sitting on the local store shelf, "why do you hate me so?"  Well, I dont hate you.  I just think you are a mindless twerp of a movie that champions every idiotic impulse imaginable in the American psyche.  This thing is about as sophisticated as a Broadway musical.  NEO is a vapid, mindless puke of a character if I ever saw one - and the casting of TED LOGAN in that role was probably the only right move the directors made?  CAPTAIN EO - sorry, I meant NEO - wants to rock and roll so badly, that it hurts.  Better call Deputy Van Halen in to save the day!  This movie deserves half a star - but I gave it two stars only because they represent the two hours of my life I will never get back.  This is the only consolation I could find... for now.   Good luck boys, Im sure the series will be a hit.      ',nonspam
' A1004AX2J2HXGL	B000024KBA	October 12, 2003	2	3	5.0	Long gone.	 Well, Ive been enjoying this album, along with the other two Syd Barrett albums for a few years now.   If you like one, youll like them all.  Syd Barrett was NOT a genius, but a very talented songwriter who "lost himself a bit", shall we say?    I try to imagine walking into a pub late one night, and suddenly faced with this guy just playing his spacey music to a pair of drunks,  a few empty bottles and a bartender smoking a cigarette.   Pure magic.  The unique music from a guy who seems to have fallen down the rabbit hole and may still down there for all we know.  I remember hearing once he was alive and sort-of well, writing a history of art never meant for public consumption.  It would be a strange come-back for sure.  However, these albums somehow leave blanks for the listeners imagination to fill in.  Ive heard REM do a cover of "Dark Globe" - and if nothing else, it amplifies the uniqueness of Syd Barrett.  It was less REM taking a song and making it their own, and more of REM trying to capture the mood of the source material by walking into Syds territory.  Ive heard Skip Spences album OAR several times;  in comparison to MADCAP LAUGHS, its musically richer and grounded in something closer to his peers.  But somehow Syd Barretts music has a charm that the other loonies of rockdem lack:  Its kind of childish, it is kind of love-lorn, sort of romantic tipping back into the tragic.  The albums capture that delicate balance perfectly - amidst all the imperfection.    "Dark Globe" is the definitive Barrett composition - not necessarily the best.  If you need clarity and meaning in music, if you need demographic, if you need a genre and something that is identifiable as this or that - Syd is not for you.  This is one of those curious albums that you come across very rarely.  Like finding an old record in your grandmothers attic and listening to it constantly - a sonic snapshot of a few random moments that will never be again.      ',spam
' A1004AX2J2HXGL	B000066EX9	October 9, 2003	11	13	5.0	Keep banging the door.	 Three discs that collect the "Bollocks" album, b-sides, studio out-takes, an entire concert and some rare live tracks:    There is one track, a cover of the Creations "Through My Eyes" which is more like a warm-up that lasts about a minute or so.  If only they had actually recorded the song full out, it would have been great fun!  Some of the well-known covers such as "Stepping Stone" and "Substitute" are presented differently; the vocal tracks are the same, but the music is an early, rough mix.  An improvement to the over-produced versions previously available.  "No Fun" is pretty much the same, they just cut it off a few seconds later so we get more studio conversation.  Virgin provides some live tracks, in addition to the complete live show, that sound more like set fillers and audience agitation; mostly moaning, improvisation and feedback.  The version of "Belsen Was A Gas" offered is far better than what I heard on the GREAT RnR SWINDLE.    The booklet is great, usual stuff about the Pistols place in rock history, what they were about, theatrics vs. bare-bones rock, blah blah blah.  The track-by-track commentary by the band is, I believe, pretty much what was published in a later chapter of Lydons autobiography "Rotten: No Irish, No Blacks, No Dogs" and on the KISS THIS CD insert.    If youre a fan, this is really the best collection available.  Hopefully, this will be the last time youll have to plunk down hard-earned cash to own some Sex Pistols product.  As they say, the swindle continues.  Enjoy...      ',spam
' A1004AX2J2HXGL	B000005JAC	October 6, 2003	5	5	5.0	punk vs. passion	 First time I heard this album, I was ready to toss it out the window or use it as an ashtray.  I put it away - then pulled it out again several months later when I took a third shift job... the punchline is I love this thing!   I can imagine dark streets, flying carpets and industrial wretchedness.  Perfect!  It sounds like third world music being played on conventional rock instruments.  Lots of sprawling, tribal-like drums coupled with J. Lydons screeching, odd voice - all other sounds fill the gap between the two.  Lydons voice seems more at home on this album more than anything else he has done.  "Flowers of Romance" is an aggressive antithesis to popular music of that time.  Not surprising.  I especially love the track entitled PHENAGEN - beautiful, almost religious chanting. I wonder if PIL will ever get their due?  Maybe one those instances, much like the Stooges or VU before them, when twenty years later someone decides this is actually great music?  Im glad I found out sooner than later...      ',spam
' A1004AX2J2HXGL	B00008J4P5	October 5, 2003	1	1	5.0	just wait & stick around...	 I keep thinking this sounds so much like a mutation of T. Rex - instead of the psychedlic/glam thing, we hear blues/punk.  The first time I listened to the White Stripes, I had a wild surge up my spine similar to when I first heard Nirvana; they have related sounds - razored down and raw, which makes sense because they share a similar musical pipeline.   The brand of rock n roll here is very visceral,  sometimes sensitive, intensely energetic and just plain cooks without apologies.  Good enough.  Much better than the bucket loads of the rubbish thats been in circulation over the past few years.    Another reviewer denounced the band as sell out material and pandering to the tastes of blank Americans?  Maybe. Theyre damn fine sounding sell-outs & manage to walk along some interesting fences.   LITTLE ACORNS is one of my favorite tracks off this one, followed closely by Girl you have no faith in medicine, ball and biscuit & the AIR NEAR MY FINGERS.   And so now that theyve enjoyed some success after kicking around a few years, interesting to see where they go.  The White Stripes are a band I think I could still be enjoying a long time from now. As a side note: some of the b-sides and rare tracks out there are fantastic & hopefully well get a collection of them in the future?      ',spam
' A1004AX2J2HXGL	B00004Z4WX	April 4, 2002	5	5	5.0	GREAT MOVIE so-so DVD release	 I agree with all the other gushings about this movie listed here.  I saw it several times in the theater when it was first released, and was simply mesmerized.  Like few other movies, I was involved in the story, felt as if I was floating above it like some waiting spirit.  Jim Jarmusch has some fairly good movies to his credit - this is my favorite.  When will they release "Down By Law" on DVD?  Anyway, "Dead Man" has the standard fair of extras - a couple of deleted scenes, a music video, but no trailer?  On chapter eight of this DVD, the movie seems to get staggered, apparently a bad transfer into the digital format.  It looks as if frames were removed, making the scene (one of the best in the movie) seem like a silent movie.  I returned it several times, and all copies had this problem.  I havent seen anything out there about this, but I wish they would correct it.  Oh well, I imagine this movie will go out of print in a year or two anyway.  The paying audience should be satisfied it was released on DVD at all...      ',spam
' A1004AX2J2HXGL	B00003CX9S	December 12, 2001	2	2	5.0	life is beautiful!	 Or is it?  I first saw this when I was maybe twelve or thirteen - I was alone in a hotel room somewhere in New Jersey, my parents were out by the pool.  I watched this movie from beginning to end - I was frightened, terrorized and very, very sad - I couldnt really describe what I went through.  I didnt want to watch this thing for years afterward.  Eventually I revisited the movie & it has become one of my favorites.  It is the only film that makes me cry, even to this day.  It is solid proof of the possibility that cinema could be the most powerful artform ever created - the closest to directly describing the carefully blended chaos of the dream.  Mel Brooks - if he made any right decisions in his career - it was hiring on David Lynch to direct this film.  Just as perfect as Tim Burton directing SLEEPY HOLLOW.      ',spam

This disc is a great introduction to the collaborative effort of Federico Fellini & Nino Rota. The music moves from the exuberant, care-free joy of La Dolce Vita, to the sadness of La Strada, to the strangely moving pieces from Satyricon & Roma - well, each track contains all those moments and more. Id give this thing five stars - if only theyd have selected longer tracks of music from each film! As it stands, some are mere fragments, and sadly understated. But all in all, worth a listen - if you end up seeking out the complete, original soundtracks - it will definitely be worth the trip.      ',nonspam
' A100TW8FZECWD6	B00000276F	March 30, 2005	2	2	5.0	It doesnt get better than this	 Like the other reviewers here, this album has a special significance for me. I bought it when I was immersing myself in classical music for the first time, and, even after buying other versions of both works from this album, I always come back to this inexpensive CD. The Serenade for Strings, particularly the Tempo di Valse, is conducted and played to perfection, and with heartbreaking emotion. How this piece hasnt found its way into countless costume drama movies is beyond me.  Ormandys New World is likewise a pleasure. When its loud, its really loud--without drowning out any instrument, no matter how small, but when its quiet its so still you can hear yourself breathing to the rhythm. Ive seen the New World performed live (a must!), but Ormandys interpretation lingers and is, for me, always the standard of comparison.  This is one of the best investments a classicul music lover can make, and it is a must for someone coming to Dvorak for the first time.      ',spam
' A100TW8FZECWD6	0394756444	June 6, 2004	10	15	5.0	A Must Read	 Contrary to what our Canadian reviewer below says, this book is not "made up" information about Reagan. These are actual remarks Reagan made; Mark Green explains in fantastic-yet-brief detail just what makes a remark yet another Reagan whopper. As for greatest President of the 20th century, sorry, but Reagan was one of the worst--he stood by while AIDS became a plague that would take 25,000 American lives during his tenure alone; illegally funded the Contras by selling arms to Iran (and lied about it until the facts wouldnt let him); supported death squads in Central America that committed such noble acts as raping nuns (to which Reagan claimed the rapists were acting in self-defense); poisoning Americas political discourse by making it okay to slime and smear opponents at will; making it cool to be a racist again with his "welfare queens" mantra; raping the environment so the rich could get richer; shifting the tax burden mostly to the middle class, who, like idiots, all but thanked him for it; expanding the government into a bigger entity than it had ever been; running up record deficits; removing the Fairness Doctrine from our airwaves and thereby opening them for rabidly partisan hate speech; and--oh yeah--selling biological and chemical weapons to Saddam Hussein. If you want to know what went wrong with political discourse in America, look no further than Reagans reign of error. All of this and more is in Mr. Greens fine collection of quotes-over 160 largish pages of them! I highly recommend this one.      ',spam

Its fragile, though, and Ive been through two of them, working on my third, in less than two years. I had the remote in my purse, dropped my purse, and a nail polish bottle falling on the remote caused the back cover to break off. Not good. The earphones have great, great sound, tremendous range, but... They are much too big for my ear canals. Wearing them for longer than fifteen minutes is painful. Im investing in Sony earbuds for this reason. They tend to fit smaller ear canals better, and the EX-71SLB Fontopias definitely fit better, with their three sizes of bud covers.

There were some things it could have gone into, but didnt, but its a short. One cant expect in depth data from film. It just doesnt happen. Some corrections to Viewer in Midwest: If ANY absentee vote isnt sent on time, then it doesnt count. Period. I dont care if its from the Almighty himself, or from a soldier. How about some of that personal responsibility that Republicans are always screaming about? As a former airman, I voted in elections in my home state while I lived far, far away. I knew what I needed to do, and the military helped with that process. Still, it is up to YOU to make the arrangements to get the ballot and send it back in a timely fashion, so that it will arrive ON TIME. And you dont bellyache if it doesnt work that way because YOU were too lazy to do it. As for Dems "starting" the craziness of the Y2K elections, of course the party leader would be there if doubts arose about the votes--thats his JOB. The Republicans made this a mess, in more ways than one, when THEY filed their crybaby lawsuits. Odd, since they dont want ordinary citizens filing lawsuits, but thats another point.      ',nonspam

The per capita violent crime rate in all of those countries is far, far lower than Americas. France alone would need another 1100 murders every year just to catch up with America on the per capita murder rate. Japan would need another 37,000 rapes just to keep up with our per capita rape rate. Germans would have to commit over 124,000 additional serious assaults on each other every year. No, were not a violent society, at all. Germany and France are fairly equitable with us on theft, overall, but Mr. Moore wasnt investigating theft. He was investigating why we like to hurt each other, especially with guns. Thank you, Mr. Moore for providing a rare, candid and thought-provoking analysis of why we do that.

' A100TW8FZECWD6	B00005O1GE	June 19, 2003	26	33	2.0	Could have been much more	 I use Word and Entourage, every single day. I use PowerPoint at least once a week. I use Excel about once every month. I must use this suite for the interaction I need with PC users, but I am not a happy camper. This program is pretty, and it has some nice features, but, overall, its mediocre. At times, its downright bad. Entourage is the worst of the programs in this suite. The freebie Mac Mail program has the most incredible junk mail filter Ive yet used. It does nearly everything that Entourage does as far as making it easy to drop pictures or attachments into email. No, it doesnt have its own Calendar, but I dont use one of those things anyway. The Entourage calendar is a pain to deal with, anyway. It doesnt lay out well, and it doesnt account for schedules like mine. I have no use for it. Entourage also doesnt have a feature to just receive mail. No, one must send AND receive, at the same time, or just Send. Maybe I dont want to send mail just yet. Sheesh. Even MacMail lets you just Get Mail, without sending. In Newsgroups, Entourage doesnt offer a preference to view only subscribed newsgroups for a particular server. No, I must go to the server, then go to View--Subscribed only. What a pain. Where Entourage really messes up is its junk mail filter. It consistently lists valid mail as Junk Mail. Much of the time, anything from Apple comes in as Junk Mail. If Mac Mail mistakenly attributes an email after its "learning" phase, correcting it is a breeze: Click on Junk/Not Junk. The program REMEMBERS how to classify mail from the sender after that. To make the same change in Entourage, you have to add the sender to your address book. Maybe I dont want Apple in my address book, hogging up useless space. Why cant Entourage just REMEMBER that mail from that address isnt junk mail??? If I can ever get Mac Mail to connect to my college newsgroups (its being temperamental about this ONE thing), Entourage is HISTORY. If thats not bad enough, Entourage [alters] information I cut and paste into its standard text window from Word. Information I get from PC Outlook Express users who cut and paste from Word likewise gets jumbled when it gets to me. This program is a horrible mess. Word has its quirks as well. Several times, Ive been working on a document, I try to save it, then the Save window DISAPPEARS. I cant do anything with the document after that. I cant close it. I cant cut and paste the info into a new document. The doc window just sits there, taking up space. I usually have to quit or force quit to get rid of it. Sometimes, Im lucky and autosave/autorecover save all my changes to a doc...but sometimes Im not lucky. Sometimes I lose whole paragraphs of data. Most annoying, and Microsoft tech help is no help at all, as usual. Word also has a nasty habit of changing the format of whole selections of text when cutting and pasting. Ill format all of a document to say, Verdana 12, and here comes a pasted selection in TimesRoman 12, or 10 or who knows what. Ive changed my styles, font preferences, everything that remotely refers to fonts in any preference window anywhere--and it still does this. Typical of all MS products, this monster known as Office has a really hard time remembering personal preferences for any of the programs, especially font settings in PowerPoint. I keep setting certain things, and Office blithely resets it to what it wants me to have, not what I want. This is like living with my mother.  Finding how to make certain settings in Office is a chore in itself. I dont like it when Word uses AutoType to input information from my address book for me, or when it tries to input a date. My work isnt oriented toward that, so this is most annoying.  The place to set this preference isnt under Finder-->Preferences (where it logically belongs), its under Tools-->Auto Correct-->AutoType. Brilliant. If I turn off my computer, my setting for this changes, according to Microsofts whim. If I could, I would junk this program.      ',nonspam
' A100TW8FZECWD6	B00006FDQR	October 8, 2002	14	16	5.0	No more gray box of death	 Apple gets a bad rap for having "pricey" computers, but Ive never found them to be such. Just look at what this baby comes with: 256 MB RAM. The wonderful G4 processor, at 800 MHz, which is deceptively fast. 80 GB Ultra ATA Hard Drive The SuperDrive which lets me burn CDs and DVDs. A crystal clear 17" flat panel display. Flat panel monitors run into the HUNDREDS of dollars by themselves (...). 10/100 Base-T ethernet port. TWO FireWire Ports FIVE USB ports (three on the console, two on the keyboard) NVIDIA GForce 4 MX Graphics card Apple Pro Optical Mouse Apple Pro speakers, and they are outstanding. Built-in Microphone Built in Airport antenna, for wireless networking. Mac OS 9 and the luscious, UNIX-based Jaguar (OS X 10.2) AppleWorks, a convenient suite of Office-type apps. Their database app is one of the easiest and friendliest around. I store lists of books, CDs and other such things with it. Explorer Quicken The amazing iApps: iChat, iMovie, iPhoto, iDVD and iTunes, all of which make computing so easy and fun in the digital age. And still more apps--too many to list here. To buy a quality PC with all of these things would cost about the same, if not more. The ports alone make this a good investment. Best of all, I know all the things in this computer will work together. Thats what having a Mac is all about. As always, Apple doesnt do anything on the cheap, not even with their "everyman" computers, like the iMac. Everything here is top of the line, and it all works beautifully. The most taxing thing about setting up the computer was getting it out of the box (the design makes it more fragile than most computers). Once I had that done, I had it up and running in about 15 minutes--and some of that time was spent upgrading to Jaguar. Connecting to my husbands Powerbook through our DSL router was as easy as clicking on Connect to Server, then clicking on his computer in the listbox.  Jaguar even recognized my sons PC, and I was yanking mp3s off there, very fast. The computer itself is very quiet, although the SuperDrive can get rather noisy at times. But the hard drive? Barely a peep out of it. The display is crisp and clean. The screen really does move with the touch of one finger--smoothly, effortlessly. The G4 processor screams through apps. Burning mp3s and CDs has never been easier, thanks to iTunes. Downloading mp3s and audio books to my iPod is a dream--and speedy indeed over the FireWire connection. I made a DVD the other day of just some clips that Id collected over the years, and it was disgustingly easy with iDVD. I connected my new Olympus digital camera through the USB port; iPhoto popped right up and filled up the screen with thumbnails of my digital images--with only one click asking if I wanted iPhoto to always do that. Everything just WORKS with this computer, seamlessly, flawlessly, which has been the most refreshing thing about switching to Apple. But lets face it: Besides the fact that its a Macintosh, which means a user-friendly computer with quality hardware, the real reason anyone buys this new iMac is because its design is flat-out cool. It is so beautiful that, even weeks after receiving it, Ill just sit there staring at it, still amazed that THIS is a computer. Having my computers circuitry nestled under a dome rather than entombed in yet another rectangular box is a delight. A round computer case! Who but Apple would have thought of it? Everybody will copy this idea (Gateway[snort!] has already tried), but, as usual, no one will come close to matching the sheer ingenuity of what Apple has done. Dont be fooled by wannabes. This is the real thing, and its worth every penny youll spend on it--and then some.      ',nonspam
' A100TW8FZECWD6	B00006FDR8	September 23, 2002	28	28	5.0	Apple does it again!	 When the iPod first came out, I wanted one, but hesitated. The hard drive on my old iMac didnt have much free space for mp3 files. Then I decided to get the latest iMac (17" monitor), and it had a nice 80 GB hard drive. That meant plenty of space to store my mp3s, so I bought the 20GB iPod as well. Within two days, I was hooked on this perfect little device, and it IS perfect. FEATURES: The touch wheel is so smooth and intuitive that I got used to it in about 20 seconds. The menus are clear, straightforward and, again, intuitive. You can browse by artist, genre, composer, song title, album. You can have playlists of songs. You can repeat one song, or a group of songs. You can shuffle. And you dont need a reference book for how to do any of it. Its all right there, at the touch of your finger. The sound is absolutely amazing--Equalizer settings are extensive. If you know how to play with iTunes, you can create your own settings, too, and theyll load into your iPod. The download speed is fricking unbelievable--When I finally had a "few" songs loaded into my new iMac (about 140), it took less than 2 minutes to download all of them, including the playlists Id set up. iTunes made the download process itself so easy--all I did was plug in the iPod and iTunes took care of the rest for me. Thank goodness for iTunes. I cant imagine handling mp3s without this nifty (and FREE) program! Oh--and while I was downloading my mp3s that first time, the iPod used my network clock to set the date and time on the player. I havent used the iPod as an alternate hard drive yet, but I definitely plan to. My husband has a PowerBook, and there are some files from my iMac that Ill want to bring with me when we travel. The iPod will be the perfect device for that. Ive looked at the calendar/contact features, but I dont really need them. My husband definitely plans to use both, though, in his work as a consultant. I have one complaint about the headphones that come with the iPod: The earbuds are too big for my ears, and hurt after prolonged listening. This is most annoying, because the headphones are very, very good. The audio quality is wonderful--my husband considers the trade of his Sony earbuds for the iPod buds a great trade in HIS favor. The remote control is great--I use it all the time, and it keeps me from having to pull the iPod out of my pocket or case to adjust the volume, pause, or skip a song (or part of a song--hold down the forward/backward button to fast-forward/rewind the current song). The battery really does last 8 -10 hours, depending on how you use the iPod. Some battery drainers are excessive scrolling and backlighting, but, even then, the iPod lasts a LONG time without a recharge. This makes the iPod perfect for me, since I work in a factory and have my headphones on most of the time. Apple doesnt tell you that, yes, you can charge the iPod through your computer, BUT it doesnt charge as quickly as with the provided AC adapter. You also dont get as much info about the charging process when the iPod is plugged into the computer. A third party manufacturer makes a car charger for iPod. I bought one and it works great. INTANGIBLES: As always, Apple makes you feel good about spending so much money for one of their products, with the little things that make your ownership a delight. Providing nice headphones, a belt clip case, a remote control, a FireWire cable and an AC adapter are great touches [...] . The belt clip is well-made and the iPod wont fall out of it under most circumstances, but the clip isnt 100% safe. I was lucky to catch my iPod before it hit the floor when the cord caught on something once, and I dont know that I would feel safe doing strenuous exercise with it; I eventually bought a more secure case from a third party. The convenience factor alone makes iPod worth every penny. Through audible.com, I can download books, and, thanks to my old portable CD car adapter, Im able to listen to the iPod in my car. This means no more lugging around pre-recorded audio books and huge CD wallets of music. No more switching CDs while Im driving. No more agonizing over which CDs to keep in my 6 + 1 player. I can record the songs I like off a CD (or the entire CD), and put the disc away, which means less wear and tear on the disk itself. I can put the iPod in my purse, rather than leaving all those listening goodies in my car, where they can get stolen or exposed to intense heat that destroys them (a serious problem here in Texas). The mirror finish on the case and remote is beautiful, but it shows fingerprints very badly. I keep a polishing cloth handy and use it at least once a day. I dont remember if Apple mentioned it in their documentation, but the cover needs special cleaners. Alcohol and acetone-based cleaners will ruin the lucite layer on the front of the iPod. Ive found that the iKlear polish kits work best for cleaning the iPod. I didnt quite understand an earlier complaint about the lack of options for naming the iPod. Maybe on the Windows version this is a problem, but, on the Mac version, renaming the iPod is as easy as clicking on the name field when you first plug the iPod into your computer, and typing a new name for your new baby. To be honest, the iPod has so many wonderful features that its just about impossible to list them all here, and the potential uses for it are mindboggling. This is THE Mp3 player to have; no other comes close. BUY IT.      ',nonspam
' A100TW8FZECWD6	1885173172	February 16, 2002	1	3	3.0	Interesting premise, but where was the editor???	 As a former engineering technician and avid mystery buff, I couldnt wait to get my hands on a book with an engineer sleuth, and a female one to boot! Im not entirely disappointed with the book.  The mystery was interesting, although it was pretty easy to figure out early on, and Schumacher managed to weave detailed engineering information into the story in a way that wouldnt make the average persons eyes glaze over.  Alvarez the detective was a wonderful character, smart, arrogant, but with a chip on his shoulder covering a wee bit of insecurity.   If only the book had been about HIM! On the minus side was the lead character, the engineer, Tory...  The authors descriptions of her were trite and repeated over and over again:  Incredible blue eyes and long legs and how tall Tory was and how she didnt have to work hard at maintaining her weight.  Yeah, yeah, I got the idea the FIRST time any of it was mentioned.  At least the author could say it in a different way the second or third (or heaven forbid) fourth round of the same description.  As a person, Tory came off as too stiff and flat, even downright cold and drab--despite having a rather torrid past.  Even her temper seems forced, somehow.  Perhaps later in the series she improves. The secondary characters are stereotypical, and some disturbingly sketchy.  Torys interaction with her son left me agog--it was virtually non-existent, even though we hear what a great mother she is.  Oh really?  She barely notices him or considers the effect her actions (or inactions) might have on him.  Her refusal to take seriously a death threat would have been understandable coming from a childless heroine like Milhone or Warshawski, but for a mother not to even consider the effect such a threat could have on her son seemed awfully cold-blooded.  The author also made a horrible mistake by not letting us "be there" when Tory received the death threat against her son.  Rather, we first hear about it thirdhand through Alvarezs POV, when Torys secretary tells him about it.  Perhaps if Schumacher had shown us Torys terror and concern for her child, I might have liked Tory better. Another annoyance was the explanations of various Hispanic slang terms, like the author thought readers would be too stupid to know what most of them meant.  It would have been different if the terms had been really unusual, or had a specific local usage, but most were standard fare.  Explaining the pronunciation of the name Jesus was downright insulting.  Nobody living in the Southwest would make that mistake, especially not anyone in a place as close to the Mexican border as Las Cruces or El Paso. Finally, I dont think Ive seen such lengthy chapters since Dickens.  Breaking up the chapters into smaller parts would have heightened the tension. In the authors defense, it was her first book, and a better editor would have corrected 90% of the faults listed above.  Perhaps Schumacher gets a better one later in the series, or, considering the state of publishing these days, she gets a clue herself about what to keep and what to cut.  Despite all the faults, Engineered for Murder piqued my interest enough to continue the series, but the priority isnt high.  Ill get to the rest of the series...someday.      ',nonspam
' A100TW8FZECWD6	0425181685	November 4, 2001	16	21	2.0	I waited so long for THIS?	 I love the Anita Blake series, but this installment was just plain awful.  Anita would decide to take some kind of action (usually saving one of her were-leopards), would take a step toward it, then detour for 50 pages to sleep with someone or wring her hands over her sexual morality or whom she might love, etc.  For it to happen once is unfortunate; repeatedly is unforgiveable.  Hamilton has never been the strongest writer in terms of grammar and style, but in the past she had a handle on plot and characterization.  Over the past two or three books, shes abandoned plot more and more, and her characterizations, though powerful, simply cant carry a book.  The publisher needs to seriously consider getting a stronger editor to rein in Hamilton before the series suffocates from egoistic bloat.      ',nonspam
' A100TW8FZECWD6	0441003745	July 4, 2001	8	8	4.0	Bloody Bones	 While Hamilton wont ever win any awards for her writing, in the technical sense, she is a great storyteller, and her characters are among the most vivid of any genre.  Anita Blake is probably the strongest heroine Ive ever read, and she continues to grow as the series progresses.  Jean-Claude is the bad boy who is much more caring and vulnerable (emotionally) than he seems at first.  By this time, Jean-Claude and Anita ought to be set in stone, almost predictable, but theyre not.  Even the secondary recurring characters have depth and are clearly defined:  Jason, Bert, Edward, Larry, Ronnie.  You feel like these are people you know. While this book isnt the best of the series, dragging out far too long and wrapping up too tidily, the scene where Anita stays with Jean-Claude at dawn merits 20 stars.  It is both heart-wrenching and horrifying, one of the most memorable scenes of the entire series. One thing that bothers me about all of Hamiltons books:  Tons of typos and other assorted errors.  Its almost laughable at times, and distracting as hell.      ',nonspam
' A100TW8FZECWD6	0312976275	June 23, 2001	3	6	4.0	Hot Six	 After rampaging through the first five novels in as many days, I was really looking forward to Hot Six, especially with that cliffhanger from High Five needing resolved.  I expected what I got with that, and that was one of the first disappointments of this book. Dont get me wrong, Hot Six is fun and funny, most of the time, but some of the humor seems a little forced and juvenile.  I didnt find the dog funny, much less all the references to his bowel movements.  YUCK.  I just wanted Stephanie to take him to the pound where he would (hopefully) be put to sleep. The plot dragggged along so much that this was the first Plum book in which I found myself skipping paragraphs, then pages to get to something more interesting.  About 3/4 of the way through, I finally skipped to the end. I find the love interest, Morelli, repulsive.  Hes a cookie-cutter romance book type of hero, and his nickname for Stepanie, "Cupcake," drives me up the wall.  The sooner hes outta Stephs life, the happier Ill be.  Ranger has possibilities.  I do like how JE has been ever-so-slowly peeling back his layers.  With each book, he gets more fascinating. On the positive side, I simply adore JEs often brilliant observations about the Jersey mindset, like how Steph knew that the woman attempting suicide at the beginning of the book wouldnt do it when she was wearing a great leather jacket.  No, shed give the jacket to a sister THEN jump.  These little gems of insight are what make JE such a delightful author to read, even when the whole of a book falls a tad short of the mark, as in this case.      ',nonspam
' A100TW8FZECWD6	0380812010	February 15, 2001	24	29	1.0	All About Love = All about BOREDOM	 I ask myself:  How many times can Stephanie Laurens write the exact same story and still get published?  Obviously, she can do it six times.  This novel is just like Devils Bride, which is just like Rakes Vow, which is just like Secret Love, which is...  Well, we get the idea.  Hero meets heroine, decides shes the one for him, she doesnt think so for most of the book, someone is murdered, hero will investigate but doesnt want heroines help, heroine is bound and determined to inject herself into the action, heroine decides she likes hero after all, they have sex, hero marries heroine, murder gets solved, everyone lives happily ever after.  This is the plot of every Cynster novel. If its not bad enough to recycle the plot over and over, the characters are always the same.  Whats the difference between any of the Cynster men, or the Cynster women besides changing a few minor details?  Characterization is much more than changing eye color, or hobby. And I swear, even the dialogue in this book is the same as all the others in the series.  This is the conversation that every Laurens Hero and heroine have in every single book, for at least half of the book: Hero:  You will marry me. Heroine:  Never! Repeat until nausea is induced. Stephanie Laurens has a true talent for atmospheric writing and, sometimes, can actually display a decent ear for dialogue.  If only she would use it!  Writing by template is never attractive, and it only gets worse with each additional installment.  And to think that there will be MORE books in the Cynster series, which Im sure will be exactly like all the others.  I could have just read Devils Bride 5, 6 or 7 more times rather than getting more books in this series. Recommendation:  Buy Cynster books used.  Please send a message to all authors that only those who bother to be original with each and every book deserve our hard-earned money.      ',spam
' A100TW8FZECWD6	6305078564	December 28, 2000	1	1	4.0	Great mini-series; lousy DVD	 My family has a rule that, if we rent a movie 3 times, we might as well buy it. I had gone far beyond my limit with the 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. I could watch this series at least once a month, maybe even once a week, and still love it. The adaptation isnt 100% faithful to the book, but, cinematically, its by far the best version ever made. On a scale of 5 stars for content, I would give this DVD 100. However, I have both of the DVD editions and I dont like the DVD transfer for either one of them.  If I could, each version would rate at nearly -100 stars. For the first set, the one with the cardboard keepcases: 1) The sound quality isnt what Ive come to expect from a DVD, and parts of the dialogue bottom out on occasion. 2) My local Blockbuster had the two-tape VHS version, with all the credits taken out except at the beginning and end of the set. This made the series flow like one movie, save for the natural break at the climax of the story when Darcy 1st proposes to Eliza, which was wonderful--perfect timing! Since I didnt see the series when it aired on A & E, it was often difficult for me to tell where the series breaks had taken place. I was quite surprised when I learned where some of them were, and this attests to the skill of the editors of the two-tape VHS version. I find the constant credits on the DVD distracting, repetitious and boring; pressing the Next button is inconvenient. As for these credits providing a break, as suggested by another reviewer--come on! DVDs are fantastic at picking up exactly where one left off, without missing a beat. Theyre far better at it than VHS tapes. If I need to go to the bathroom or get another tub of popcorn that badly, Id rather stop a DVD wherever I please, rather than waiting for the appearance of credits I dont want to see anyway. Thats as bad as watching the prison known as TV (UGH). 3) I also find this a very chintzy DVD--no language selections, no subtitles, no "goodies," such as cast bios. It didnt even have closed-captioning! Very, very cheap. As much as my husband paid for this DVD as a Hanukkah present to me, I expected much more for his money. So now Ill search for the VHS version I prefer. Maybe Ill buy two, in case one wears out. For the second set, the one with the plastic keepcases: A&E finally gets their head outta their youknowwhattee and gives us non-stop storytelling along with some cool goodies like cast bios, widescreen and subtitles/captioning.  Then they RUIN it all with the most hideous color transfer Ive ever seen on a DVD.  I had to spend over half an hour getting the picture even remotely bearable to my eyes, and Im still not satisfied with it.  The entire DVD is now unwatchable for this alone.  Will someone at A&E please please PLEASE fix this? As I stated in my original review, perhaps the producers of this series will heed the many complaints theyve received about the DVD transfers and re-issue a much better version in the future.

' A100TW8FZECWD6	1885478461	October 28, 2000	6	8	3.0	When the advice here is good its really good, BUT	 When its bad, its really bad.  I agree with the first two reviewers that this book has too many "shoulds" that may not work for every writer.  I, too, found the concept of talking about writing to a trio of pretend writers very silly, boring, pretentious and wasteful.  Selfish as it sounds, I dont care about THEM, talk to ME--you know, the person buying/reading the book!  Ironically, one of the first articles is "Never Lose Sight of the Reader."  Too bad "Lady" Barrow forgot about that. One column in the book is about socio-biology (a.k.a evolutionary psychology) which I found extremely sexist and offensive.  While it purported to address why women read romances, I found none of its arguments convincing.  Apparently, the entire staff at Romantic Times subscribes to this highly controversial theory, because they frequently refer to it in the magazine and on the website.  Anyway, the writer of the column isnt a romance novelist or editor or publisher, I dont even think shes a psychologist (I think she may be a lawyer) so who cares what she has to say about psychology in romance books or anything else? This book shines when successful authors discuss the nuts and bolts of writing and getting published in the romance industry, when the various sub-genres are described and explained.  Read those and ignore the rest of it.      ',nonspam
' A100TW8FZECWD6	050552337X	September 19, 2000	9	16	2.0	Slightly better than its prequel	 Rejar from Knight of a Trillion Stars goes to Regency England.  In the  previous book, he was fun.  In this, his own book, he becomes as arrogant  and repulsive as his brother, Lorgin.  The heroine in this book, Lilac, has  several more watts of brainpower than Deanna, for all the good it does her.   Lilac is still more of a dim bulb than even the average romance  heroine. Its still okay to Dara Joy to humiliate and degradate her  heroines.  Dara Joy heroes always treat the heroine like a dog on a leash,  dragging her here and there, telling her what to do:  "Stand up, sit  down, good girl."  Dara Joy heroes also have a bad habit of constantly  telling a heroine that he just knows she lusts after him.  He knows all,  even if hes an alien visitor to earth, and the heroine knows absolutely  nothing, not even her own mind.  Protest any of this arrogance?  How dare  the woman do that?  What little protests arise from the females dont last  long and can easily be conquered with a leer or a sneer. If thats not  bad enough, this author thinks were supposed to find it romantic when  Rejar rapes Lilac, but its not. Its not enough for a hero in a romance  book to be beautiful, physically...um...fit, and sexually obsessed.  If he  cannot prove hes caring and loving, at least with the heroine, hes not  worth the paper hes written on.  Rejar had so many possibilities that he  never gets a chance to live up to--and that is a tragedy.      ',nonspam

Im glad I obeyed the  instinct. Painted by the Sun is about Shea Waterston, a traveling  photographer who is following the orphan trains west to look for the son  she gave up a decade before.  While setting up her camera to photograph a  hanging, she meets Judge Cameron Gallimore, who promptly throws her--and  her camera--in jail.  The Judge, however, has demons of his own, and he and  Shea recognize each other as kindred spirits. Elizabeth Grayson writes  beautifully about 1870s Colorado and a relationship between two tortured  individuals who are inherently decent people.  Cams sister, Lily, his son,  Rand, and Rands friend, Tyler, are well-portrayed.  Shea, especially, is a  wonderful character.  Unlike most romance heroines, she is no prissy,  helpless virgin.  Shea is pragmatic, self-sufficient, and experienced.  And  dont cross her, or someone she cares about, if she has her Winchester  rifle nearby! This is a wonderful book.  Read it!      ',spam
' A100TW8FZECWD6	0821769820	August 20, 2000	7	9	5.0	Schone pushes the envelope	 The Ladys Tutor is not an adventure-oriented romance.  Its plot centers primarily on the discoveries Elizabeth Petrie makes about herself, and  subsequently about everyone in her life, as she searches for happiness.   Little by little, Elizabeth realizes that her surface wants signify deeper  problems in nearly all of her relationships.  She is a strong heroine who  decides that her lot in life is not enough, that its okay that she not  only wants but DESERVES more from life--and she is determined to have it.   Better yet, she gets stronger as the story goes along.  Bravo to her!   Elizabeth is not the standard romance heroine:  shes older, married to  someone other than the hero, has children for whom she is a good, devoted  mother, and is only of average looks.  How refreshing to read about such a  woman! Ramiel is more of the traditional romance hero:  Handsome,  brooding, dominating, mysterious, and sexually, er...gifted, yet still  appealing, especially after he opens up his sensitive side to  Elizabeth. The gem of this book is Ramiels mother, the Countess, who  refuses to hang her head in shame for surviving being kidnapped by Arabs,  becoming a sheiks concubine, and bearing him a child out of  wedlock. Robin Schone is one of the rare writers who can dish out a  scorching-hot romance with believable plots and characters.  Most of the  romance writers who focus on the sex in their books tend to let their plots  disappear or, worse, their characters become either unsympathetic or  one-dimensional.  Or, sometimes BOTH.  Schone does not make any of these  mistakes.  Its the best book shes written, thus far.  READ IT, READ IT,  READ IT!      ',spam
' A100TW8FZECWD6	0553574272	June 8, 2000	6	6	5.0	A fantastic romance	 Its not very often that a romance writer dares to have a woman and man be FRIENDS first--best of friends at that, then lovers.  That alone made this book a worthwhile read.  I tire of all those bickering couples.  Lovers  spats now and then are expected, but, really, the constant arguing to mask  quivering sensitivities does get old.  A good plot needs conflict, but  quarreling over the usual well-worn devices ("S/he is only using  me," "S/he doesnt/cant really love ME," etc, ad nauseum)  doesnt necessarily qualify for that. This book doesnt do that.  The  main plot revolves around finding out who has kidnapped the heroines  brother, and why.  The answer really isnt a surprise to anyone who has  read the spy books of John Le Carre. The romantic plot conflict is very  real, and very understandable:  Were all thrown for a loop, to realize  that someone we THOUGHT we knew so well might have some traits, or secrets,  that we hadnt expected.  It takes some time to adjust, to get past the  feeling of betrayal, the feeling that we werent trusted with certain  information, to trust again.  As is often the case, doubt leads to doubt.   It is how the lovers overcome all the havoc wreaked by so much doubting  that makes a story. Hugh and Abbie are able to overcome these problems  not for a reason as idiotic as being good in the sack together (although  they of course are), but because they have a stronger foundation than most  romance-book couples:  They are friends, first.  Thank you, Ms. Thornton,  for writing a romance book that makes sense, romantically speaking.      ',spam

I  was so exasperated that I didnt finish the book.  Sure the sex is hot, but  thats not enough to sustain a book.  Go to any porn shop bookshelf for  proof of that. I, too, tire of the man as sexual teacher and the virgin  heroine.  At least The Ladys Tutor didnt resort to the latter.  The  Romance genre desperately needs some new ideas, some writers who will push  the envelope.  The Ladys Tutor was a book that did that; The Lover did  not.      ',spam
' A100UZ3LRLU135	0345446860	January 9, 2006	1	1	5.0	A Sure Surprise For Me	 I settled into this book expecting to hate it but fueled on by the need to finish it for a pressing book club meeting.  What I came to realize was that it was real.  This is a story of a woman who, through a jag of self-reflection, comes to realize that she is who she is because of the choices she has made.  At the beginning, it seems that she has, indeed, become the wrong person.  If she had followed her first "path" clinging to sadly pathetic, totally uninteresting Will Allenby, her life would have been different...but not necessarily better.  Instead she has a chaotic existence as a party-planner who hosts every kind of celebration in her own home while continuing to be the only real parent her 3 step-daugthers and 1 biological daughter have ever known.  She is a witty, vital woman with a family life so full and vibrant it seems funny that she wishes (for a time) that it could be some other way.  This book is really about the passage of time and what comes when we become "adults" who think that the mystery and longing of our dreams can no longer have sway in our lives.  Rebecca (Beck) comes to realize that dreams are not just for little kids and they never materialize in the way we want or expect they will, but they do happen.  I think she moves from an adult who feels stagnant in her life, to a child-like woman who can recognize that life is really about moments and what we choose to do with them, than accomplishments or who we are seen with.  The best part of this book is that it is not "chick" lit, an assumption that scared me at the beginning.  This book defines the difference between settling for a life thats dictated by circumstance and settling into a life one has sculpted over time through decisions made consciously.  The characters are vibrant and, although not always likeable, somehow shockingly real in their humanity while the story moves in such a subtle way, the reader is almost surprised when its over.  Yet, the ride is comfortable and real, leaving me longing for just a little more.  I think thats the mark of a great novel and this one has it.      ',nonspam
' A100UZ3LRLU135	B00005JNJT	July 25, 2005	5	6	5.0	All Prequels Should Try to Top This One	 I generally think movies are far too overpriced so I generally wait for DVD, but Im glad I didnt wait on this one.  This film is what the "Batman" series has been waiting for: a good solid foundation on which all of the crazies and the politics are based.  Ive never really truly understood the plight of Bruce Wayne. Poor rich baby.  However, this film not only goes way back to show exactly what happened with his parents, but also chooses not to neglect the road he had to travel to become the caped crusader.  I thought the screenplay, the script, was excellent because it told the story as a novel would, fleshing out necessary characters and giving the audience their motivation as well.  I thought it was great to see where Comissioner Gordon started out and how Gotham became the center of all corruption.  I thought the movie did two things really well: get to the heart of the problem in Gotham through the hero/villain that Liam Neeson played with such expertise (he was trained well in Star Wars) AND cast Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne.  Finally a guy who can pull off the drama and the action and still maintain a somewhat "upper crust" feel that is so necessary to this character.  If the casting in this movie(minus Katie Holmes who was enthusiastically average as the do-gooder-slash-supposed-love-interest) had been present throughout all of the sadly misguided versions of Batman movies over the years, the sum would be classic.  As it is, they do make up for the horror of Chris ODonnell and Alicia Silverstone as Robin and Batgirl.  And thats bringing us back a long, long way.  Kudos on this one.  Im definitely buying it on DVD.      ',spam

I have loved watching Harry and his mates grow, learn, change, and become real people learning hard life lessons.  Having said that, this sixth installment is by far the most complex, dark, and real of all.  For me, it would have been hard to top the 4th book which has remained my favorite up until now.  However, this one is so much more emotionally vibrant without being over-stated that I applaud Rowling for her growing capacity to weave a wonderful story through characters who have been molded and crafted over time.  These are not just the "fun adventures of little kids dabbling in magic" anymore.  With the reappearance of Lord Voldemort and the Death Eaters as a real force, not just a remembered one, Harrys destiny becomes much clearer; the reader is left to realize how dark this tale could end up.  I finished feeling a little scared for every non-Muggle in Harrys world and I loved that.  I liked everything about this book.  The others have been ultimately focused on the action in which the characters partake.  This, however, was much more about the emotion, which I think is the next dimension to understanding the greatest villain ever written.  This shift goes right along with the way Voldemort works: he scares people.  Sometimes he has to do it through action, but mostly its just the thought of him that induces fear.  That is subtle and this entire books revolves around that subtlety. We learn his history as Harry does; the battle now becomes three-dimensional as intellect must be paired with the bravery that Harry has so embodied up to this point.  I cant wait for the last in this series, but honestly, Im glad it will take awhile.  I need some time to recover...and, of course, to re-read.      ',spam
' A100UZ3LRLU135	1400062314	July 11, 2005	7	8	3.0	An average debut	 I was excited to read this book, waited months reading reviews and gearing up for a real ride.  I was disappointed.  After finishing what was a seemingly endless story focusing on the four years of Midwestern Lee and prestigious and snotty Ault academy, I was not surprised this was Sittenfelds first novel and I was shocked that the marketeers aligned it with Salingers masterpiece.  I did quickly take to Lees character and as a person who attended an all-girls school and is now a high school teacher, I could immediately see how dead-on the description of that first year was especially from the young womans point of view.  My problem began when time started passing and Lee, so full of potential and possibility, became this static slug of a character, slogging through her life and not growing or learning much. In the beginning, I was led to believe that Lee went to Ault to change her life and realize things about herself she couldnt in her boring life in Indiana.  The last three years at Ault betrayed any of that hope.  In concept, the novel was good.  Teenage years are tumultuous, to the point that reality just does not seem real.  Because of that I thought there would be so many 3-dimensional characters, good and bad, to really make the fictional gauntlet of high school as interesting and heart-rending as it can be in reality.  This heroine, though, was boring and made me wish the book was about some of the other characters. Personally, I wanted to read more about Martha and that worried me a little.  Whenever secondary characters start stealing the heroines thunder, there might be some problems brewing.  I started reading this really wanting to like it.  I ended up feeling that the best thing about it was the textured preppy belt cinching the cover.  High school is a colorful place to be. Its a shame I can only describe this novel as bland, flat, and prosaic.        ',nonspam

As a collection of essays using the Harry Potter characters and settings to illustrate classical themes and concepts in philosophy, this book makes every reader an intellectual. I especially like that the authors dont assume the reader is in kindergarten or has never heard of Aristotle or Plato before.  I thought every chapter was thorough but understandable to the lay person.  I walked away knowing a lot more about philosophy but also appreciating the depth and care of the Harry Potter series as well.  I wouldnt recommend this to a non-"Potter fan" as it would be annoying.  My one beef: there are some of the corniest references to Potter that could ever be written on a page.  I almost got the feeling, at some points, that these philosophy professionals were so excited people cared, they went over-board and tried a little too hard.  All in all, an excellent read.  One of the reviews on the cover said that this book made philosophy and intellectual discussion a daily dinner event.  I am happy to report I couldnt agree more.      ',spam

' A100UZ3LRLU135	0449912558	July 8, 2005	3	4	3.0	A Great Idea	 After I found Mary Doria Russells "Thread of Grace" an excellent read, I went back to her first work hoping for the same reaction.  Though the whole premise of this book is highly inventive, interweaving the progressiveness of the Jesuits with the idea and reality of travelling through space to contact other worlds that exist, I found the execution of the action to be plodding.  Initially, I thought her characters were well drawn and certainly believable. I actually walked away wanting to talk personally with all the members of the crew who went on the voyage. And, as the center of the story, Emilio Sanchez is a work of psychological brilliance.    But, as great as the characters are, if the movement of the story does not complement them, they will end up average and thats how I rate this novel at its completion.  Personally, I found the pacing uneven; at points I skipped whole segments of pages because I couldnt stand to read another word in the "martian" language or another technical description of how they were going to land the ultra-light.  I also thought that with the huge build-up to landing on Rakhat, there would be something there that was just as inventive as the mission before the landing.  I was completely unimpressed with this "other world."  In the end, I thought Emilios story told in the year 2066 was the most compelling part of the novel.  To witness the effects and try to understand what happened on this botched mission from his perspective was fulfilling and interesting and it made me feel true compassion for this man. That was the genius in this work.    While the research involved in getting all kinds of details correct, including the inner-workings of the Jesuits to the engineering and technology, was amazing, I think MDR relies on that too heavily.  She and her characters really shine when she relies on her knowledge of people and the way they work.  Thats why Emilio and his lessons are what I can take away from this story.  In the end, was it a good read? Yeah. Will I read it again? Nah.      ',nonspam
' A100UZ3LRLU135	0375501843	July 8, 2005	9	9	5.0	An Artful Novel	 When I opened the cover of this book which I read for my bookclub, I was nervous.  Not only was there a map of Northern Italy, but there was a list of several pages of characters whose names seemed vaguely similar.  I thought, "Oh, here we go. I never like when I need roadmaps to read a story..." Yet immediately I was plunged into a tale so tragic but joyful, complex and yet simple at the same time, I was hooked.  This is not what I would consider an easy read. I spent a good deal of time going back to read a page again because the pace of the novel is, at times, feverish.  But I am always a fan of the novel as an experience and this book gave that to me.  I emotionally reacted to the characters, at times I felt as out of breath as they were, sometimes I was confused.  But in the end, I grew to love them as people.  To me this is a testament to the fullness of their portraits drawn by a skillful, if at times ambitious, writer.  In the middle of reading this novel I had the pleasure of meeting Mary Doria Russell, so perhaps this skews my review positively, but that doesnt make me change it.  Based on my experience with her earlier work, this one makes me a full member of her fan club. MDR comes into her own through these clever people who knew such pain and terror but also love and life.  Usually, I base my rating of a book on whether I would actually sit down and read the entire thing a second time.  With this one, I emphatically would.  MDR deserves all the praises she gets for this intricately-woven story.       ',spam
' A100UZ3LRLU135	0060937580	January 6, 2005	10	11	4.0	A teaching essential for students of Catholicism	 Thank God someone has finally stepped up to the plate and dared to take on the questions of "What do Catholics actually believe and WHY do Catholics believe this?" in a tone that suggests there might actually be some meaning behind the doctrine of this monumental institution. From the first page, Weigel establishes exactly how he will respond to the ever-present critics and cynics who keep the Catholic Church constantly in their sight: truthfully, carefully, and without apology.  What a refreshing change in a cultural climate that suggests the Church exists for something other than the mission on which its foundations were originally established.  While I ultimately love and appreciate the content of this book, especially a light but accessible treatment of the true theology behind Catholic doctrine, I give the book four stars and not five because of a specific detail that, for me, detracts a bit from the overall point of the book. Weigels clear and undying devotion to Pope John Paul II, a figure who was also the focus of a Weigel biography, clouds any attempt at an objective treatment of problematic doctrinal issues.  I think some of the problems that create such cynicsm when it comes to the Church today are glossed over in an attempt to "protect" the portrayal of this man.  While I completely understand the intention, this fact does seem to taint some of his credibility in reaching the people who may be questioning some of the decisions of the hierarchy of the Church. While Pope John Paul II has been a great positive force in the Church, he hasnt been the sole positive force in the Church which is a claim that Weigel implies at times.  Overall, this is the best book Ive found for answers to some very complex questions.  For a faith that, at times, appears completely countercultural, often for no good reason, this book gently but surely straightens out any misconceptions and paints a reasonable picture of the thought behind the belief.

' A100UZ3LRLU135	0316740403	January 6, 2005	9	9	5.0	A piece of literature for true mystery lovers	 As an true and devoted mystery novel addict, I have had a growing annoyance with recent books in this genre; many have become predictable, boring, uninventive and sometimes just crass.  Kate Atkinson has renewed my faith in the belief that a good mystery can be considered true literature as well as a real mental exercise.  I was especially impressed by two elements in this novel.  The first is simply the believability of her characters as full and faily regular people, most of whom carry emotional baggage not totally unlike the normal person.  All characters appear to be returning from a trauma that has changed them and, in the short journey the reader takes with each one, they share a journey to realize who they are apart from their residual grief.  The second source of ingenuity is Atkinsons gift for weaving a complex and compelling plot.  The action of this story is vibrant and insists the reader tackle just one more page to see whats around this next bend.  The grip of this story is immediate and intense enough to ensure that just the experience of reading becomes an active exercise of mind and heart rather than a passive, and sometimes frantic, turning of pages to get to the moment of revelation.  The shape of the plot causes you to begin to care for all the characters whether or not you like them.  All I know about myself is that I enjoy a great story.  Atkinsons latest made me savor every page, especially once I realized how special and rare this work is.  Just after I finished the last word I decided it wouldnt be a bad idea to flip to the first page and start over again.      ',nonspam

However, Frankens book was truly enjoyable from the first ad hominem insult hurled to the final quiz that leaves no reader behind.  I love the fact that he takes to task the people who are running the country and those who think they should be.  This is the literary equivalent of "pants-ing" George dub-ya, his cronies, and all his wannabes that enable him to lie and get away with it.  And I say good for Al!  Should it be read with a grain of salt?  SURE, every political commentary carries that warning, but should it be considered garbage because he brings to light the conservatives ugly dust-bunnies that have been shoved under the rug?  No.  The best thing about this book is that it forces the reader to ask, "Is this REALLY whats going on?"  It motivates the intelligent reader to become informed, to seek more information--which is what every voter in America should be doing anyway.  Congrats to Al and the members of Team Franken--you have made politics a dinner-table topic thats accessible to political apathetics like myself.  And you completely leveled Bill OReilly who has been asking for it ever since he hosted the highly acclaimed political juggernaut "Inside Edition."  Way to go Al!

' A100YHBWL4TR4D	0743246071	June 30, 2005	7	7	3.0	Just OK	 Frankly, the authors odd choice of writing almost completely in comma splices really put me off. I found it hard to concentrate on the story when this major usage error kept popping out at me over and over. I only wish I was exaggerating.  Aside from that, the story moves along, and I was intrigued by the characters. Frankly, I thought the best part of the story was the portion the protagonist, Hannah Green, spent in Calais. I was much more interested in her story as a Jew in the Renaissance than all the palace intrigues.  I did not understand Hannahs divided loyalties. She seemed to serve several masters and equally love them all, which didnt make sense to me. Also, no reasons were really shown why she should love these people, who really hadnt done all that much to earn it, frankly.  The writer seemed to me to choose very obvious aspects of Judaism to demonstrate her characters religion, although perhaps this was on purpose, too. One would not necessarily want to confuse Gentile readers who didnt know much about Judaism. Gregory also has the excuse that her characters are actively hiding their religion and do not remember all their customs, nor keep them out of fear of being discovered as Jews. Still, I found the depiction of this side of Hannahs life rather basic.  Another complaint I have about Gregorys writing is that her dialogue is not period, which is something I noted while reading The Other Boleyn Girl. It is a little off-putting to find so much non-period dialogue in a piece of historical fiction. Particularly annoying was the repetitive use of "Dyou" for "Did you."  After I have said all that, you might wonder why it merited the "three stars." Like I said, it was readable. I did become interested in the characters. I dont think I could have finished it, considering all its flaws, if it didnt have these good qualities. I found it odd and intriguing to see Mary portrayed so sympathetically. However, to paraphrase Will Somers, the Fool, history did not remember Marys good qualities, just as they did not remember her fathers. As he is remembered as a lecherous wife-killer, she is remembered for her burning of "heretics," mostly Protestants, which rightly earned her the appellation Bloody Mary.      ',nonspam
' A100YHBWL4TR4D	0812968972	June 30, 2005	3	3	4.0	Art Imitates Life	 The novel begins in 1490s Florence, just as Lorenzo de Medici dies and the city comes under the control of Savonarola. To Alessandra Cecchi, the main character, it is a frightening time, as the rebirth and flowering of the Renaissance seems perilously close to being snuffed out forever. Alessandra is strong-willed. She has a fine mind and the latent talent of an artist, but she is often discouraged in using both. Alas, she is a free-spirited woman in a harshly patriarchal society.  Alessandra is married off to politically astute and sensitive Cristoforo. The marriage allows Alessandra to have certain freedoms that she craves, but it also stifles her -- Cristoforo is homosexual, and he cannot feel passion for Alessandra. Instead, Alessandra is captivated by the young painter employed to create frescoes for her familys chapel.  The book was well-written, and I definitely felt as if characters were rendered honestly, with special attention given to the times in which they lived. Amazon recommended this book to me because I bought books by Tracy Chevalier and Susan Vreeland, whom they considered similar. If you reduce Dunants book to simply being a novel about art, then yes, they are similar. However, while Vreeland and Chevalier write about well-known artists and/or works of art and their backstories, Dunant has created a fictional art world. None of her characters are famous, and we cannot be sure that anything they created is today the admired creation of an unknown artist, but they do live in fascinating times, and I was easily swept into their story.

' A100YHBWL4TR4D	0812972597	June 30, 2005	5	7	4.0	Fine Tragicomedy	 Phillips walks the fine line between humor and pathos quite successfully, and he manages to pull off a bit of a mystery that will keep you turning pages -- not so much because you wont figure out what happened, but, as reviewer Barbara Mertz in The Washington Post concluded, how it happened. The story is told through letters and the journal of his main character, Ralph M. Trilipush, a man I loved to hate and hated to love -- self-absorbed and exceedingly arrogant, but naive -- and you just have to admire his determination (or obsession? you decide). One of the major themes of the novel is the legacy we leave behind and our quest to become immortal -- a different method for each character, yet somehow it all comes down to the same conclusion. What that conclusion is, Ill leave you to discover. The ending is probably one of the most tragicomic things Ive ever read. I wanted to laugh and cry at the absurdity of it. Indeed, one could accuse Phillips of bathos, but then, I think thats what he was really after. Thats kind of what life is, in the end.  A warning to the reader: this book will require patience. It unfolds slowly, layer by layer, through the words of two irritating narrators. However, it is the preciseness with which Phillips captures "that sort of person" that makes the outlandish events believable. I enjoyed the writers style, but it might not appeal to everyone.

' A100YHBWL4TR4D	0156032325	June 30, 2005	9	10	5.0	A Chiller in the Image of Classic Victorian Literature	 THE GHOST WRITER is probably one of the creepiest, most thought-provoking books Ive ever read. The story centers around Gerard Freeman, an Australian librarian who lives with his mother -- a clingy, obsessive woman afraid above all that Gerard will leave her. His only real friend is a pen-friend, Alice Jessell, an English woman with an injury which confines her to a wheelchair. Though the two have never met, they have been corresponding since they were 13 and eventually fall in love.  Gerard is intensely curious about his mothers past in England at a country manor called Staplefield, where she lived with her grandmother Viola, who raised her. Gerard finds a photo of a strange woman and a Victorian ghost story written by V.H., who turns out to be Viola.  Gerard eventually makes his way to England, where he begins to unravel his mothers past, meanwhile discovering more ghost stories written by his great-grandmother which oddly seem to intertwine with the lives of her descedants.  John Harwood does a masterful job creating suspense in the manner of Henry James THE TURN OF THE SCREW, to which he alludes in the name of Gerards penfriend -- "Where, my pet, is Miss Jessel?" Violas Victorian ghost stories are interwoven with the plot in a rather impressive plot construction; it would have been all too easy in the hands of a less-gifted writer, for the plot to go astray when the ghost stories "interrupt" the action of the novel. As it is, they hardly seem like interruptions, and indeed, they are so good that they might stand on their own. "The Gift of Flight" was terrifying and reminded me a Twilight Zone episode I once saw called "The Living Doll." Youve probably seen it... "My name is Talky Tina... and Im going to kill you." *Shivers*  This isnt Stephen King. This is much, much better. If you liked the Victorian creepiness of THE TURN OF THE SCREW, GREAT EXPECTATIONS (also alluded to in THE GHOST WRITER), or even A.S. Byatts POSSESSION, which was both very different and very similar in subject matter (which I know makes no sense), then youll enjoy this book. Gerards mothers home in England reminded me of the house in THE OTHERS. Once you pick this book up, you may find it hard to put down. The ending is a bit confusing. I had to read it twice, and I still think what I think happened is very much open to interpretation. Then again, the best scary stories are like that.       ',spam
' A100YHBWL4TR4D	1592572405	May 27, 2005	4	6	3.0	Only OK	 I did not find this book to be as comprehensive as I would have liked. For instance, the only holidays he really explains are Purim, Hanukkah, and Yom Ha-Shoah. He mentions Yom Kippur only in passing; considering it is the most important Jewish holiday, I think merited much more explanation. There was no mention of Rosh Hashanah. I did find the coincidences of tragedy falling on Tisha BAv interesting -- I definitely did not know that so many devastating events, from the destruction of both Temples to the expulsion of Jews from Spain all occurred on the same day. Rabbi Blechs notion that it is a message from God certainly seems plausible.  I was struck by the rather biased tone of the book. There are several instances in which Rabbi Blech infers he believes the Jews to be a superior people. He states twice that Jews have higher IQs than other ethnic groups. While Im not saying he doesnt have a point, I think it is dangerous to proclaim any group superior to another, even a group that has fought adversity (and won) since its beginnings and survived despite several attempts to exterminate them. He seems to have a somewhat anti-Christian bias, which is not something I have encountered with my co-workers or students. To be fair, most of that comes out in the chapters in which he recalls the worst acts carried out by Christians against Jews -- the Crusades, the Inquisition, expulsion from various countries. I did find some of his remarks about Jesus interesting. I wonder if it is widely accepted, for instance, that Jesus was an Essene? It wasnt something I knew.  I felt that the book was not as comprehensive as it might have been, but it is understandably hard to define the history and culture of an entire people who have survived over 5700 years. I realize the "Complete Idiots" series is designed to be an introduction, but I cant help but feel like I ate what I thought would be a fairly decent meal that left me still hungry.       ',nonspam

Cushman makes no effort to glamorize the Middle Ages, as many writers do. Her account is realistic and thought-provoking. In response to another viewer, who stated  that this book should be avoided - "I think, in a time when our youth  are struggling to find a healthy self-image and healthy relationships with  others, this is a book that should be avoided" - I think this reviewer  really doesnt see the larger picture. This is how life was, and I think  teenagers do not want their literature to lie to them. Life isnt always  pretty. Not all the people who lived in the Middle Ages had money, or even  morals. That is true today as well. I think a young adult reader is capable  of reaching a conclusion about a characters motives and morals without our  help. More than anything else, this book will really teach readers about  REAL history.      ',spam

This book was more disappointing than even his religious sci fi.   Conrad Davis slips into a parallel universe where Christianity hasnt happened yet and a new messiah named Eli is born in a laundry room in Santa Monica.  Somehow the world had evolved as if Christianity had occurred however:  hotel rooms have Bibles including only the Old Testament, not Talmudic tracts, the non-Jewish characters do not worship Greek gods but are monotheists, there are crystal cathedrals and evangelical theme parks celebrating Old Testament figures and a monotheist God- but they are certainly not Jewish. Did the Reformation happen anyway?  While the idea of a Messiah ploped down in contemporary life has potential, this book doesnt achieve it. The concept is half-baked and the interspersing between realities and memories is confusing.  None of the characters is fleshed out- maybe Myers is better when he writes for actors who can add personality. Its a shame.  In religious fiction Myers is certainly no Madelline LEngle and not even a C.S. Lewis.      ',nonspam
' A100ZQDV7L8PVV	1592443133	February 17, 2004	17	17	5.0	Was Jesus an observant Jew?	 Harvey Falk, a rabbinic writer believes that Jesus can only be understood as an observant Jew who upheld most of the doctrine of the School of Hillel against the School of Shammai (although he broke with Hillel on the subject of divorce.)  He sees Jesus as on a mission to encourage the gentiles to follow the Noahide laws (the seven commandments given to Noah which all righteous gentiles must follow according to Judiasm in order to achieve salvation.) He sees many condemnations of the Pharisees in the Christian Gospels as reflecting the often quite contentious disputes between the two schools. Falks style of writing is more likely to be familiar to Jews who have learned Talmudic defenses of halacha than to Christains.  Falk goes both forward and back in rabbinic history to justify actions of Jesus.  The book is extensively footnoted with reference to rabbinic texts. Although I believe that Falk stretches things at times to indicate that Jesus and his followers always followed Jewish law (picking grain from the field on the Sabbath probably was not to forestall starvation,) he makes an excellent case that Jesus was primarily observant.  (Although Christians often believe that healing the sick by prayer on the Sabbath was forbidden (Matthew 12:9-14), it was not explicitly forbidden by Jewish law and the text probably refers to a dispute between the schools of Hillel and Shammai on how high the "wall" should be around the laws of keeping the Sabbath.)   The book presents a vivid picture of the first century and its theological disputes.  Falk looks at scriptures of Judiasm, Christianity and the Dead Sea Scrolls to convey the contemporary contraversies of that time. I highly recommend this book both to Christians who want to understand the Jewish roots of Christianity and elucidate heretofore obscure sections of the Gospels, as well as to Jews who want to understand a first century rabbi whose teachings have largely been excluded from Jewish studies.  Note that Falk is NOT a messainic Jew and believes in a dual covenant theory of salvation.  His book was done primarily to foster understanding and dialogue between the two religions.      ',spam

The dry foothills of Californias Salinas Valley, the rough side of Salinas (the town where Steinbeck grew up), Monterey, even San Franciscos Chinatown are lovingly detailed in this portrait of the California of Steinbecks early years.  Members of the Steinbeck family including John make cameo appearances in the book, although a reader would need to have that fact pointed out. Curiously Steinbeck allows no motivation for Cathys (Kates) evil- she appears to be simply bad seed, whereas Calebs greatest sins are seen as understandable reaction to Adams failings as a father.

' A100ZQDV7L8PVV	0895298368	April 2, 2001	7	7	5.0	At last, an Oriental materia medica in English!	 I am most enthusiastic about Robert Risters new book, "Japanese Herbal Medicine:  The Healing Art of Kampo".  While I am not a practicioner of Kampo (I come from a TCM/Western Herbal background) and cannot judge his portrayal of that system, Rister has written an excellent book for those trying to bridge their understanding of Asian and western herbal databases.  My favorite part is the materia medica of 157 herbs and medicinal substances, organized by English common name, with Japanese names in parentheses and an appendix with Chinese, Korean, pharmaceutical and botanical Latin names and additional identification and dosage data.   A common problem with American students of Oriental herbal medicine is that they often are unaware that the substances they use are the same as western herbs they may understand- for instancea common form of Wu jia pi (Acanthopanacis) is Siberian ginseng or that modern Mang  xiao (Mirabilitum) is Epsom salts.  This book allows one to do that. Up to date research on the herbs is presented in clear English, combining new knowledge with traditional uses.   Extensive references are in an appendix.  I spent several hours cross referencing this book with Benskys Materia Medica and added as much from one book as to the other. The Kampo book tends not to include animal products used in Chinese medicine, as well as herbs used primarily in external application or against parasites, which accounts for its smaller database.  But it includes the most important herbs used in Chinese and Japanese medicine. The book is not organized by Chinese medicinal categories, although functions and indications are described in the text.  It does not have a list of tastes, temperatures and channels, but  parts of the body affected and organoleptic qualities are included in the text.  One annoyance is the lack of a separate multilingual medicinal substance index, but the general index includes herbs by Japanese and English names.  Occasionally I had to look up an herb in Bensky, check its Japanese name and refer to the index.   One major criticism is that I was not always certain that the research referred to the botanical species used most prevalently in Japanese (and Chinese) medicine (although I admit that I havent yet spent time digging through the references).  And one listing might be given for several parts of a species- like Lotus root, leaf, seed-receptacle, stamen, seed and sprout with the text addressing the various strengths in sketchy detail.  Like most other Oriental materia medicas it lacks information on endangered species, cruelty (though few animal products are included) or modern substitutes like Serrulata sheng ma/black cohosh or Typhonium ban xia/pinellia. There are sections on formulas, diseases organized by western name with differential diagnosis within the disease discussions, sources of Kampo goods and services and 65 pages of references.   An excellent adjunct materia medica for students of Oriental Medicine.      ',spam
' A100ZQDV7L8PVV	1885653077	September 3, 1999	54	55	4.0	One of few books to list nutrients and minerals in herbs.	 This book is one of very few that list the nutrients found in common western and Chinese herbs, allowing one to find which herbs are good sources of, say selenium or beta carotene. As such it is an important  addition to any herbalists library.  However like most food science  analyses, the book lists nutrients found in the plant, not nutrients which  can or will be absorbed by the human body.  For example, aluminium intake  is closely regulated by the gut flora and excess aluminum is normally  excreted unless that flora has been decimated by antibiotics or unhealthy  diets.  Its presence in an herb does not automatically mean that an herb  like echinacea, which rates moderately high in aluminum, should be  avoided. The actions of herbs often go far beyond their constituents.   Yellow dock, for example is not especially high in iron, yet yellow dock  tincture (which contains very little iron at all) can in low doses allow  the body to overcome anemia far faster than iron supplements. However  with those caveats, the book is highly recommended.  It also lists actions  of herbs, the body systems affected, folk history and use of the plants,  medicinal properties, chemical constituents, nutrients of note and typical  dialy doses in various forms.  Of particular note are traditional  combination formulas which are analyzed like the single herbs for their  nutritional profiles.

There are 240  picture listings of different herbs, animal and mineral medicines.  Each has a 5"x7" photograph of the herb  in its various forms, laid out on a neutral background.  For example,  astragalus is shown skinned and black skinned, with both forms obliquely  sliced and in stick form, and with honey fried and pressed forms as well.  Codonopsis root is shown with longitudinal slices stir fried in  earth,unprocessed longitudinal slices, unprocessed uncut lengths and  transverse and oblique slices.  Since Chinese herbs are prepared in several  ways, a person used to seeing the distinctive pattern of round slices of   Baikal skullcap root, for instance, may find the longitudinal slices  difficult to identify. The book is organized into barks, stems and woods,  roots, rhyzomes, leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds, herbs, resins and balsams,  animal medicines, minerals and mushrooms (curiously omitting Ling  Zhi/Ganoderma/Reishi from the mushrooms.) .  Each herb has Latin, botanical  Latin,English, Japanese and Chinese Pinyin and character names, alternate  names, physical descriptions, descriptions of characteristics of high  quality herb,  production areas, properties and actions, indications and  constituents listed.  The book omits discussion of endangered species or  substitutes, although the latter can be inferred from the drug function  comparisons tables.   There are 356 traditional formulas, although  preparation instructions are scant, making the book more useful to someone  seeking to understand the contents of formulas than to prepare them. The  discussion of drug processing aims and methods is very useful to someone  coming from a western herbal background, including processing to eliminate  or reduce toxicity, to enhance actions and to change the properties of  herbs.  A glossary of Chinese medical terms is also included. The indexes  are particularly useful to anyone who struggles with the various  transliterated, botanical Latin, pharmacological Latin and other names.   All English, Latin, Pinyin and transliterated Japanese names are listed in  a single index.  (No Wade Giles transliterations however). There is a  Chinese character index as well.

My favorite new herbal is Paul Bergners excellent book, _The Healing Power of Echinacea and Goldenseal and Other Immune System Herbs_ (Prima Publishing, 1997). I hadnt ordered it previously thinking it was a short review of  the two herbs.  Big mistake!  It covers the immune system and the whole category of immune modulating herbs. This book is good for anyone who would like more background in the workings of the immune system (including health care professionals who know the physiology but are not used to thinking of immune function as a system)  At least a quarter of the book is dedicated to the functioning of the immune system, covering technical material in prose ranging from humorous to stunningly beautiful.  He has a gift for chosing just the right metaphor to explain difficult concepts. In the section titled "Protective Powers: the Healing Power of Snot" he describes the IgA-saturated mucous secretions as a "sophisticated, genetically enginee! ! red antibiotic paste that is tailored to whatever infection is current."  The antibodies carried in the mucus are produced in immediate response to current infections in the body and will attack them while protecting your tissues.  In other words, dont try to stop your running nose! One reason for tasting herbs- indeed holding them in your mouth for a while before swallowing- is that lymph nodes are located just behind the tongue.  Echinacea for instance works best to stimulate lymphatic activity, but first it must get to the lymphatic system. Lymph, unlike blood, does not have a pump to circulate herbal factors.  So if it lands in your stomach in a capsule, the herb may not get to the lymphatic system where it is needed- or at least may arrive ineffectively.  (This is aside from taste preparing your liver to utilize herbs.) The book also covers the titular herbs in detail, with emphasis on proper use, situations where they are inappropriately applied (90% of the tim! ! e for goldenseal) and when alternatives to the endangered g! oldenseal can be used.  For example, he shows that goldenseal should NOT be taken when you are coming down with a flu or cold, although echinacea might be quite effective. Oregon grape OTOH is quite useful at that time, as a berberine-containing substitute for... echinacea.  Goldenseal probably has no effective substitute when a long term cold or respiratory infection starts to turn bacterial, with yellow  or green mucus because the hydrastine works directly upon the mucosal secretions. And goldenseal works NO better in large doses than small doses- as single capsule or half-dropper of tincture is all you will need for a dose.   The book covers a number of alternatives to echinacea and goldenseal, shows unusual uses for them and gives recipes.  It is well worth adding to your herbal bookshelf.      ',spam

Not just soldiers, but men of the higher ranks, mothers, spouses, family of deceased men and women.  They were not given adequate armorment, they had shortages of simple things like water, they witnessed other soldiers hatred of all iraqis, even if they werent the enemy.  These are voices from the war, voices that think the war is unjust, some concealing their names for safety reasons, some disclosing their names for all to see that they spoke out.  A war that will go into history as a calamity similar to vietnam.  These are soldiers who feel betrayed by our president, a president bent on thriving corporate interests, who wanted iraq only a day after 9-11 began.  The letters express hatred, anguish, fear, but overall- betrayal.  A medic didnt have enough scrubs to wear and clean while operating on soldiers wounded in battle, so the mother and a friend make them and send them to the unit.  A soldier writes about his interactions with iraqis, " we pick up rocks before patrol for the kids that will no doubt be throwing them at us." Soldiers are told to run over anyone threatening on the roads, while most run to the roads begging for food or a handout.  Most just feel that they had gone to a just war, but after time it felt much different, they didnt want them there, the soldiers didnt know their mission.  The worst letter to me was a soldier who came home with post traumatic stress disorder, but a high rank captain told him not to go home and cry about PTSD, you can get over that by going to the bar and downing some drinks, he was made to feel like a wimp if he needed help.  The soldier ended up killing himself.  I definitely recommend this book to anyone with a soul, something Brian who gave the book a 1 star doesnt have.  You are a moron!!!!!      ',nonspam
' A101AFHY8G9PCV	B00005JNEI	September 26, 2004	15	23	5.0	True Patriot	 This film was touching, truthful, and rightfully damaging to the regime we call the bush administration.  All republicans do to condemn this movie, which most dont even watch, is say it is full of lies, which it is not, if so-prove it!  They cry "Moore has an agenda to get Bush thrown from the whitehouse because he is biased".  Of course he is!  When your president is so completely unfit for his command why would you not be biased towards him.  Get him out and try something new.  I often laugh when debating a repub over  our president , because they are so brainwashed and argue about a movie that in my experience they hadnt even watched.  I ask, how can you argue that point when you havent even watched it. And the reply is "Yeah...and ill never watch that garbage. "  I mean come on!  Pathetic is a word that comes to mind.  There may be others as well.  Get some balls, watch the movie, try not to let your head explode with frustration as you wonder how your president could be so careless.  Then in typical republican fashion just disclaim the film as all lies! LOL. You have no argument. Wake up. The proof isnt just in the film, but in the feelings of many soldiers in iraq right now.  In the feelings of hundreds of protestors at every single stop Bush makes across the country.  A country divided more than ever.  There has to be something to these strong feelings.  Its time for our own regime change.  Wake up America - Bush doesnt care about you. Michael Moore should be saluted for his bravery.  The patriot act probably has him classified as an enemy combatant now.      ',spam

I understand some liberties must be sacrificed in times of conflict.  The government just after 9-11 was running straight from the executive branch without any checks and balances.  Of course who would dispute or bring up civil liberties in times of crisis, obviously not anyone in the courts.  People were labeled enemy combatants and contained without right to trial, any proof of guilt, and held months without anyone even knowing their whereabouts.  Many were probably guilty, but some were innocent and in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Our government wanted to get people to act as spies, surveying their neighborhoods, spying on neighbors, getting your library to turn you in as a terrorist for reading muslim literature or something containing dissent to the govt.  Luckily that brilliant plan of ashcrofts has not gone over to will not be tolerated, and should not be tolerated by the citizens that are supposed to be the backbone of our democracy.  Very informative book.  AMerica must fight to revise this orwellian act that is the patriot act.      ',nonspam

It is rare that a politician recognizes the need to heal an environment that is being destroyed by its inhabitants.  Gore not only describes the effects of Global Warming, Ozone depletion, deforestation, faulty irrigation, but also delves into the evils that are corporations swaying the views of high ranking officials to turn the other cheek towards the environment.  George W. Bush is doing it now.  Although most scientist agree these are problems, Corporations put out loads of propoganda saying it is junk science supported by only a few "scientist" who are in it for big incentives and overall greed.  The book expresses the need for USA to take the lead in changing the effects of the overall corrosion of earths balance.  The fact that people can dismiss the enviroment and the health our children makes me sick.  Quite honestly it makes me ashamed to be an american.

Republicans will rage over that statement mainly because they know theyve got no argument.  Biggest surplus to the worst deficit.  Completely dismantling clintons environmental laws, which should be one of the most important subjects on the table, considering there are hormone disrupting chemicals contaminating our bodies and undermining our fertility as we speak.

Major noticeable differences between the C-8080 and E-300: Zoom control(mechanical ring)!!, Shutter Release speed, speedier autofocus,  CF write speed!!!, speed in working with RAW files, 10+ excellent preset scene shooting modes (Sunset, Night, Fireworks, Beach/snow,...) to help even a beginner produce great looking images.

After pinnacle released a few patches and instructed me to "clean my registry" to update things I got some things working better however nothing works quite as promised. I still have yet to get this to encode things in motion-JPEG format as the package indicated it could! The program let me capture video (after hours of tweaking settings and disabling other programs) at a fairly high data rate (high quality video) however when I went to burn the footage onto DVD, the program would automatically RE-encode everything at a very LOW data rate- resulting in fairly poor quality images.  One of the main reasons that I purchased this equipment was to archive home movies in a high quality format.  To date I have only been able to archive footage at low quality- even after months of discussion with customer support.

The book opens with her still in the book world, two years after the end of the last book.  Thursday is getting tired of the book world and begins to want to go back to the real world.  So she takes a sabbatical for an unlimited time, as the council will not let her retire as they like her two much.  Once back in the real world with Hamlet in tow, she must face questions about where she was for the past two years, everyone assumes that she was in prison.  The government in the real world is at a state of turmoil, a really right wing party, lead by the fictional man Kaine, is trying very hard to get into power, and Goliath has become a religion, but still maintains its power and such as in the previous books.  This party has decided to blame the countries problems on the Danes, i.e. people from Denmark, thus Thursday having Hamlet with her are not exactly a positive.  The government is burning all Danish books and other activities targeted at this group. Then it is revealed that Goliath is becoming a religion to avoid a prophecy made by a 13th century saint, which says that if Swindon Mallets win the croquet finals then Goliath will fall.  It is important to note that the Mallets are not only a terrible team, but also since Goliath does not want to risk falling, other teams are buying all their tolerable players.  To make matters worse, if the team does not win the world will end.  Thursdays husband is still gone, but Thursday is trying throughout the book to get him back to stay.  There is much more in this book then the simple plot lines illustrated above, it is truly a remarkable book, with many layers and subplots, and hidden literary references.  Also Fforde plays with our notion of time more so then in the previous books, and makes one question what the present actually is and how it fits in with the timeline of our life.  Once again in this book we see how ones death and the end of ones life are not actually the same thing.  Much of the book revolves around the notion of death, and what it means to have a near death experience.  The reasons why the book lost the .5 it did was because certain plot elements are not really explained, the only example I will give is that Goliath eventually brings back Landen, but we never really are given a reason why.  However the book is an incredible achievement and I would highly recommend this book, it truly is a one of a kind read and will make you think, I guarantee it, however it still feels like pure fun.

' A101X5KFOHP7TC	0192833944	August 18, 2004	4	4	5.0	Gothic writing at its most scandalous!	 Often when one thinks of "old" books the ideas of sex, violent murder, evoking the powers of hell, incest, unbridled lust, rape, and transvestites are not what come to mind. However, all of these are in The Monk.  This is a book that was viewed as incredibly scandalous, and even today this view still holds up.   There are two main plots in this book; first there is the story of the monk who is known for never having given in to temptation or sin.  His prot g  revels that he is a women and she is in love with him, the monk.  The monk withstands her advances, but we see that in his thoughts she is present.  Finally he gives in and they...repeatedly.  She, Matilda, opens to him a world of passion, and lust, which he enters with great gusto.  After a while the monk grows tired of this women and when he sees the young girl, Antonia, a girl of extreme innocence who is said to have been created by god in the image of an angel, he is completely overwhelmed with feelings and decides he must have her.  He tries at first by simply seducing her, but her mother enters and teaches her daughter, hitherto ignorant of such acts, that this is wrong.  Back to our monk who is now very put out, Matilda says she will help him, as she actually does love him to the point where she will do anything to help him. As it turns out Matilda has power over the evil spirits, and she has pledged her soul to the devil.  She gets the devil to help the monk by giving him a spell that will open any door and make everyone sleep.  This will allow him to enter Antonias room, do what he wants, and the next morning she will know she was raped, but not by whom.   This plan fails and then the monk must try other, more horrid ways of getting at this young woman.   The second story is that of Don Raymond and Agnes.  These two are in love, but by a series of mishaps have been separated and Agnes is in a convent of St. Clair.  One night these two `give into their passions and the result is Agnes is pregnant.  Our monk finds this out and tells the head of the convent, who severely punishes Agnes by locking her up with the intention of killing her.  To make matters more complicated Agnes brother, who is in love with Antonia, knows that Agnes is in the convent and has an order from the church to release her from her vows.  The head of the convent tells him that his sister is dead, which he does not believe. Thus the brother and Don Raymond will have to save Agnes quickly. If ever you wanted to know what happens when you throw a bleeding nun, a wandering Jew, the devil, a monk with a huge sex drive, a cross-dressing prot g , a girl of extreme innocents, an evil prioress, and a gipsy who see the future into one book this is defiantly the book for you.

Every single gothic plot or image is in this novel.  The main character is an interesting and enjoyable character, though she and her lover do spend far too much time weeping, and one really does mean to say FAR too much.  She is the exact opposite from Catherine in Nothanger Abby, except in the idea of letting their imaginations get the better of them.

Well, Neville seemed to be slightly too entertained with putting historical personages into her books.  By the time Napoleon made his appearance I simply rolled my eyes and breathed a slight sigh.  Apart from the over use of historical people, the book had other faults, at times it dragged a bit and sometimes it was a bit obvious, but these can easily be ignored because the books positives far outweigh its negatives. Neville has the promise to become a great writer of the thriller genre, however, she still has a ways to go, the Magic Circle is not to be recommended and I have yet to get my hands on A Calculated Risk, but this one, The Eight, was an excellent read.  It makes one think, and get interested in Mathematics, which, coming from me is say a great deal indeed.  I did take some humor in the fact that most of the main characters history comes from the Nevilles on life (including her name Catherine verses the authors Katherine, I prefer it with a C personally).  Please dont mistake my tone for one of simple satisfaction, I strongly recommend this book, and I thoroughly enjoyed (almost) every moment in it.        ',nonspam
' A101X5KFOHP7TC	0142001805	July 27, 2004	4	5	5.0	An Original Masterpiece	 I had given up fantasy novels a long time ago, after reading The Lord of the Rings I found most other fantasy novels cheap, cheesy, and clich d. Not a good combination. This book selected at random from a store in Cambridge, Mass.  Where I was visiting family.  It was to be my escape for the noise and hubbub. And it was, for the three hours it took me to devour this delightful novel.  Think The Never Ending Story meets The Third Man meets Tarantino and all this in one book about books!  For, almost, once I have no complaints about characters, plot devises, or writing, save perhaps that the book was a tad to short and the fourth is taking a tad to long before publication.  I would recommend these books to practically anyone.  It helps to have read certain book prior to reading this one or any of the next, for instance Jane Eyre, Great Expectations, and as many others as you can think of, since these books are packed with literary references, but do not get discouraged if you do not get them, lord knows I do not get them all.  Even with out getting the lit. references one may still thoroughly enjoy them for what they are, great works of modern fiction.        ',spam
' A101X5KFOHP7TC	0399151613	July 27, 2004	14	18	2.0	Great Marketing	 I received this book as a birthday present, having earned the reputation as being one of the largest Jane Austen fans in existence, at the age of 14 I knew Pride and Prejudice better then the back of my hand, having read the book more then 25 times, and since then many more.  Austens other books I, no doubt, no as well as the back of my hand, I just happen to give preference to Pride and Prejudice. When I was given this book, I was expecting more talk of Austens books and more intertwining of their plots with those of Fowlers.  The main problem with this book is just that. I, and I am sure many others, pick this book up to hear about Austen, and Austens brilliant characters, however this is not the object of this novel.  This is a book about Fowlers characters.  She wants us to care about her characters not about Elizabeth Bennet, Emma Woodhouse, and Marianne Dashwood, and Austens other great characters.  This brings me to the next problem, which relates to this previous one, and that is that the characters of Fowlers creation can not stand up to those of Austens, since Against giants even great mortals look small. While Fowlers characters are not bad, they are not great, they are all to particular, to extreme, to unique, these traits, usually desirable in characters, in Fowlers case one must say that there is to much of a good thing.  All her characters come of a flat. Overdone.  And unbelievable.  They already have a hard task set before them; to live up to Austens followers expectations of characters is difficult, but not unachievable.  These characters do not make it. Indeed they are still miles away from it.  Apart from the characters faults, the writing itself is awkward and uneven.  At times she seems to have got it and then within a page she has once again dropped the thread, this creates difficulties in the reading.  I would not recommend the purchase of this book. If you really must read it, wait till your library gets it.  However, I would recommend that your time would be far better spent rereading Jane Austen herself.  Since this book provides no real discussion of Austens books, read them for your self and then discus them with someone.  You will get far more out of it, and it will be much more enjoyable.

' A101X5KFOHP7TC	038549081X	June 18, 2004	12	33	1.0	Ughhhh.... one of the worst yet!	 When we were assigned this book for my English class, my first thought was one of interested.  I, like many, have always heard of the "Great Canadian Author Margaret Atwood", and I eagerly began to read the book.  As I waded my way through awkward prose, and over symbolic plot devises, I came to realize that if this was a `great Canadian author I shudder to think what the not so great are like.  I found it rather odd that the only form of rebellion the `enslaved women took was swearing, thinking and committing sexual activities, and dreaming about beauty products.  To think that in a book with such strong feministic undertones that these would be the only dreams, thoughts, and activities of women who are denied such things as reading, and the pursuit of knowledge, seems almost as flawed as the prose she uses to declare them. I was greatly disappointed at Margaret Atwoods writing, and wonder why the truly great Canadian authors, such as say Robertson Davies, are not made a larger part of the education system.  In short this was one of the largest disappointments I have come across in my lifetime, and look with fear towards the next of her books I will be forced to read.      ',spam
' A101X5KFOHP7TC	1400049490	June 18, 2004	5	7	3.0	Interesting...but had some shortcomings	 The book, Dark Matter: The Privet Life of Sir. Isaac Newton was a very interesting book.  I read through the first 250 odd pages with excitement and enjoyment. However, once the book reached page 300, it felt like the author realized he had to finish it and then quickly tied up all the lose ends almost to neatly.  My other main problem with the book is something, which I encounter with the vast majority of modern fiction, and that is sex.  There seems to be this idea that a book must have at least one scene during which people must engage in the act, now I understand that on occasion this is important to the plot or the character development, however, must we actually be subjected to a detailed analysis of the actions preformed? This book would have been better, and the characters as well developed had we not been privileged to their sexual activities.  Still on the whole, it was an enjoyable book, with strong characters, and an interesting plot.      ',nonspam

Saba moves in a different direction from the original Scholars beats and makes some instrumentals that are a little more soulful and much more produced. This probably has just as much to do with the fact that he is maturing as a beat maker as it does that he is working with an emcee whose style is rooted in the original boom bap. Ra is a nice emcee who has suffered in the past form not having the right beats. This time he gets to flex his lyrics about love, life, and the greatness of hip hop (KRS-One anyone?) over 13 mellow and fun beats. The sticker on the front has a quote from KRS himself saying that this is "real hip hop" and that fact is played upon continually. Scion likes to speak about unifying hip hop and supporting all the elements. He likes to use hip hop as a way to create a peaceful and nice world. But most importantly he likes to talk about hip hop in general. Whether he is shouting out the South Bronx (?) or every Seattle emcee he is truly a lover of this culture. While this is dope to hear and he has dope beats to rock his knowledge over it gets a little tedious and repetitive after multiple listens. If you want something different and fun, pick this up and be ready for and education cause Common Market shows that fun hip hop with meaning can be made and enjoyed; you just got to give it a chance.

Bun B is no newcomer though. Having released classic albums as the un-incarcerated half of UGK, he helped pave the way for the Texas and more specifically Houston revolution that hip hop is seeing right now. Buns legendary status is obvious as this independent release shows some of the biggest emcees in the game making appearances, including Ludacris, Jay-Z, & T.I as well as a whos who list of Houston rappers. As far as the music goes this album is your typical Houston gangsta funk. The beats are straight forward thumpin 808s that have been made famous by the likes of Mannie Fresh and KLC. Fresh makes a couple of the soundscapes for B to rip and they sound as perfect as any cash money banger of the past. Jazze Pha pops in to delivering his traditional mix of southern hip hop with that hit of soul and funk that he brings to a track. As far as the lyrics go this is basically Bun and friends getting hard. Buns voice is deep and strong which makes his tales that much more believable. While he can make an album full of the same topic matter and sound convincing the best track on here is "The Story" (10) which is just that: The story of how he as come from the bottom to the legend he is now. This album is another essential release from the town that seems to be never ending with hits right now. Houston Stand up and lets get screwed!      ',nonspam
' A1020L7BWW9RAX	B000BEZOWO	May 1, 2006	1	1	4.0	Something new, interesting & definetly different	 This record took me forever to get. Actually Im still not sure if I "get" it, but when a record has rave reviews all over the net and I think its bad I doubt myself just a little bit until I have listened to it to death. That being said I have been rocking this record in my MP3 player for a solid month and I am starting to see what those cats are talking about. But only sort of. Emcee Baje One and producer Snafu have a special chemistry here that really does seem kind of scientific, or maybe thats cause of the topics to rap about: Time travel, plutonium, liquefying ice, etc. Needless to say this album is a little different, but they do it well and with precision. Baje One is a solid emcee with a dope flow and a confidant swagger that is present in many NY representers. Snafu makes beats that bounce and weave around the lyrics usually with only one thing being steady: the dusty drums. At times comical they have created an album that is truly nerd rap, not because they are using big words but they literally are talking about things that my chemistry genius girlfriend would love. Not to say they dont get their straight up hip hop on either though. On "House Wigger" (14) they address those who may be posing as something they are not (and hip hop seems to be full of em). If you are looking for something a little different and fun this album is for you, just be prepared for something you have never heard and may never hear again. Junk Science = dopeness on record, it just takes forever to really sink in.      ',nonspam

A combination of the Prefuse perfected hip hop meets electronica and straight up dance/electronica music Jimmy Edgar shapes an off beat but not album in Colorstrip. While he obviously knows how to man a synth and drum machine he needs to stick with being behind the boards cause laying down vocals is not his strong suit. On "My Beats" (2) he is literally talking (not rapping, not off key singing, talking) and it is just annoying. While some may find it fun and maybe this is what is popular on the dance clubs over the pond I cant get into it. On the beat side of things he does have some cool creations. While definitely in the same vein of Prefuse he does his own thing and he does it well. I can totally see Lady Sovereign, Dirty Rascal or any other grime artist rocking to many of these instrumental tracks but on top of that I could see an emcee with a sporadic flow (Aesop Rock?) sounding very dope over the creations that Jimmy has cooked up. Edgar shows his skills behind the boards and demonstrates that whatever genre this music could be called he is a straight up musician and should be respected as one.      ',nonspam

If three artists, all experienced members of the Jazz, Rock, Funk & Electronic music scenes, were ever to come together for one night and record an album live Jungle Funk is as a good a representation as any. Vinx, Doug Wimbish & Will Calhoun joined forces April 12-14 back in 1998 to create music that is just that: MUSIC. This can not be classified or categorized. It is an amalgamation of every genre these men have ever worked with or been influenced by throughout their lives. Bringing a unique combination of Drums, Guitars, Samplers, Synthesizers & their own vocals Jungle Funk is funk for the party in the Jungle. Whether you are looking to lay back and chill with some instrumental jams, vibe out to a laid back soul number, or get your freak on on the dance floor this album has it all. With no set pattern these three men combine their musical genius to create something that I doubt could ever be done again. Overall an experience on record that can transport you to wherever you want to be and bring you back in one piece; leaving you feeling a sense of awe like you have just seen the future and the past all in one.

Sample based music has not sounded this good since DJ Shadow stepped on the scene with "Endtroducing." Not that I am comparing Dilla to Shadow, they are both masters of their craft and very different crafts they have mastered. Where Shadow only works with a select few emcees, Dilla has been producing for emcees most of his career. His work has shown no particular love for either coast being involved with both Tribe and Pharcyde heavily in the early to mid nineties before going home to link up with his Detroit brethren Slum Village. As he grew his sound did to demonstrated by his work with the Okayplayer collective. Dilla eventually found his way to Madlib and the stones throw family and one could say that was the first stepping stone to the birth of this album. Dilla was always  known for his samples and the art of digging up just the right loop for that perfect beat, and Donuts is no exception. Made in large part while he was in the hospital fighting Lupes (the disease that would eventually claim his life on February 10, 2006) and other complications arising from it, Dilla never could put in enough work. He had released three other beat tapes similar to this one to the mixtape circuit in the last few years and has two more albums on deck for this year and next. Donuts shows all his artistic influences over the course of its thirty one tracks from dusty drums, to the soul and funk of the sixties and seventies, up to that new Madlib funk that must of rubbed off on him. Dilla was a genius with the turntables and sampler always knowing what the beat needed to be complete. With this album he knew that his time was coming and as it draws to a close you can just feel the samples he chose shouting out to you saying thank you and goodbye. Well Jay Dee it is us the listener who should be saying thank you, we love you and goodbye, Rest in Peace the one and only J Dilla AKA Jay Dee.      ',spam
' A1020L7BWW9RAX	B000BC8T3M	April 6, 2006	0	0	4.0	Just a good dope record!	 Jnerio Jarel? Who that be? This is what I thought when I received this album in the mail to put in rotation at my radio station. Well this kid turns out to be a producer extraordinaire who happens to emcee just a little bit to. As soon as you pop this album in you are welcomed to his world which is just a little different. Presently residing in Philly he has spent much of his life all over the place. Born in Brooklyn, acquiring the art of rhyme in Houston and perfecting it in New York (with stops in many other places in between) Jarel has a wide range of influences that make his album that much more intriguing. With obvious ties to the Philly "Sound" his style is all his own with influences ranging from the Native Tongues to Soul & Jazz, and even to that Madlib funk. Jnerio gives us an album that is both instrumental and rhymed on. Some tracks he delivers that classic soul vibe and he may throw some ad-libs in (and you thought only commercial artists did this!) with a singer such as Vinia Mojica, of Reflection Eternal fame, crooning away like it was a jam session with the around the way band. Or he may just deliver a straight up hip hop cut where he flows to a beat that he cooked up with who knows how many samples layered in. Overall Jnerio delivers an album that is more like an unsolvable puzzle: the combination of styles, samples, and guests will prevent you from ever fully completing it, but they will also leave you no choice but to keep coming back to it.

' A1020L7BWW9RAX	B000008PQA	April 4, 2006	0	0	4.0	Something Different for all Yall (3.5 Stars)	 So the old adage proves true once again: Take one look at this albums cover (and title) and youre likely to think that Jeune is some gangsta rapper outta LA. I threw it on and damn was I surprised! Not only is he about as far from a rapper as you can get but he is one of the best singers I have heard in a very long time. Granted that this album is eleven years old and from a label I doubt few have heard of, it still has that intangible feeling like "wow" how did he not get noticed. His session musicians do a great job of bringing that old school funk/soul vibe to the album instead of just having some prerecorded beats for Jeune to rock over. This is what really makes this album. Sure we have many singers today and some truly are talented but none of them have that musicianship backing them. Gone are the days when David Axelrod or the Mizell Brothers produced your record from the ground up and recorded the whole thing live in the studio. For that fact alone this record is worth checking out, when was the last time you heard a real soulful singer singing over some real soulful & true music? "Back to Reality..." may not be the most amazing or original thing ever produced but listening to it over ten years later it still sounds fresh and impresses me for what it is: Some guys who just love music and were looking to try and effect change in their community with their music.

He also happens to be a straight up nice emcee. No he is not the second coming of Jay-Z but he has some skills and does a good job of flexing them on this 6 track (w/ 5 actual songs) EP. When I read the title I thought it was going to be some kind of advertisement for helping focus kids and push them in a positive direction. After listening to the album though I dont see how its any different from any other album released from someone who spent their early lives dealing drugs and sticking up people. So once you get passed the title having no bearing on the content of the album and just look at this as any other hip hop album you can see that this kid Bishop from Newark means business. His flow is straight up east coast and even if he does claim Newark as home he spent plenty of time across the water in NYC. His crew Committee holds their spot well with none of them showing Bishop up but still showing that they can rap to. The beats are top quality making you wonder why they are only releasing this EP. In the end this album stands out with dope beats but falters when you realize that although their hood tales are constructed well they are not saying anything different from every other hustler turned rapper in this business.

Named after her newly formed record label based around the shining star that is Sacario (what happened to this kid?) this album shows Angie stepping up her game and putting Cool & Dre to work before they were Fat Joes go to beat makers, and before they were big time producers for that matter. When Angie dropped her first album it seemed she was counting on her radio ties to make a name for herself by loading the album with big name guests. That album was also received as some what of a joke being that she was a radio DJ (and quite a successful one at that). But with this album she is trying to show that she actually does have some skills on the mic and has an ear for talent as she picked up the aforementioned Sacario and Cool & Dre before anyone else new about em. The lead single "If I Could Go" featuring Lil Mo and Sacario is a hot club banger with Mo dropping a hook very well and both Angie and Sac come with it and Rick Roc drops an infectious beat that can double as both a hip hop club song and as a song that you could salsa to. She calls on a few big name friends such as Missy Elliott, Petey Pablo and Noreaga to come in and add some life to a few tracks. Her alliance with Fat Joe goes beyond just picking Cool & Dre to produce over half the album as Tony Sunshine drops in on the Ski produced "F*cked Up Situation" (10) and Fat Joe himself joins her and Sac on "Live Big remix" (13). This album does a good job of introducing us to some new talent and giving Angie Martinez a name as a solid emcee and not just someone who is trying to hustle her NY fame into worldwide fame.

Well that crunk sound has been being developed for many years and it was first seen back in the 80s and was known as Bounce. Developed in Miami and exposed to the world but Luke and the rest of the 2 Live Crew, bounce was bass heavy music for clubs. One of the other early emcees in this developing scene was JT Money and his crew the Poison clan. While Luke and his boys got famous off of mindless songs about sex JT and the Poison clan actually had some skills and were a little more hip hop and a little less bounce. This CD is a collection of the best songs that these guys did and you will find a lot of the typical topics: hoes, dough, and some hood stories. The poison clan is a decent group of emcees but there is a reason that JT is the lead. He can take command of a song and he does construct some good lines. The clan backs him up with mixed results: sometimes they are on point but sometimes they just dont have enough presence to get you to listen. The bounce sound can get a little repetitive at times and when they make the joints that are just crazy bass with chants it is really hard to listen or take it seriously. If you are a crunk fan then you had best learn where your music came from and see how it should be done. JT Money & the Poison Clan use simple drum beats to spit their stories and they do it better than most trying to today.      ',nonspam

The album opens with the upbeat "Blessed 2 Have," which gives praise to everything they have had in their lives. As the song progresses you see the chemistry they have together and how well the poetry works with the singing. The music is understated on most tracks allowing the vocals to carry the songs and allowing her to stretch out a little bit, expanding the overall feel of the music and contributing to it rather than just being vocals over a beat. This is what shows you that she is a talented singer: She makes the song have life and musicality. The other half of the group demonstrates her title of flo-a-cist throughout the album with styles ranging from spoken word (Let Me In #4), to straight up emceein on "Supastar" (2) where guest Common drops a verse just to show you that these British girls are down. As the album progresses you get the sense that they wanted to give you an album you could put on and chill to, but that also had meaning and was on an old school tip. While its a mellow album with generally down-tempo love songs they are pure beauty and remind you of the days when R&B didnt exist and it was Soul music. These women make some of the best Soul music you have heard in quite some time and there have been few albums that compare in recent memory.      ',nonspam

Cage has more than most, some thanks to his own doing and some from factors out of his control. He took control of his life and showed the demons that they had to leave him. He quite the drugs, quite the junk food, quite the rock-n-roll lifestyle altogether. He found a label that believed in him and could give him what he needed musically (and financially), with no restraints. That is what "Hells Winter" is; Cage in his purest and truest form speaking on his life. No more misogyny, no more acid trips, mo more over the top shock and awe rap. Whether airing out his issues with EC (Public Property #12), airing out his issues with the current administration (Grand Ol Party Crash #3) or just wylin out with his weatherman crew (Left It to Us #11), Cage is a transformed man. He confronted what had been done to him in the past and took responsibility for what he has done in the past, and wrote about it. Not only did he write about it but he brought it to life. The combination of him and El-P is amazing. El delivers some of his most symphonic beats yet. They are just as full of life as the verses Caged penned for them. On top of that El is just a little connected and brought in some friends. DJ Shadow makes a very special appearance with his crazy drum programming. Blockhead just blows your mind with his contributions finding the most subtle, and beautiful combinations of strings, horns, and drums. RJ is here in typical fashion with the MTV ready "Shoot Frank" with an unbelievable hook sung by Darryl Palumbo. The bottom line is one emcee had an opportunity to create something special, and while most would cower at that challenge he took it head on and delivered something right back that no one would have ever predicted.

The Roc fell apart and they moved on to The Mint and deliver a 20-track album with five chapters and mix results. My first thoughts about this album were that it was too long and that has proven to be true upon repeated listens. The other question I have is what the significance is of the chapters. They are trying to tell a story but the songs in each chapter do not always match up with the chapters title. As far as the music goes, its just ok. There are lots of R&B/Soul singers out doin their thing and these two are no different. They have the intense sexual songs (Presidential Suite #8) and they have the love song that goes out to the girl they lost (Farrah #15), did they ever stop and think maybe if they were not out trying to freak every girl they might not have lost that one perfect one? The production is nothing special, Kenni Ski does a decent job pulling double duties as singer and primary beat maker. The one thing that it seems these brothers got goin for em is that they can sing. Their harmonies and verses are generally on point and stand out at times, compared to the rest of todays modern so-called "Soul" singers. If you are looking for some real classic type soul music then go check Bilal, but if you want modern R&B with a touch of the classic seventys sound this album will probably at least wet your appetite.

They received mixed reviews of their last album "To the 5 Burroughs" but they include a few cuts off that joint as well. The most impressive feature of this album is the sequencing. If these three kids can sequence an MPC without fail, why couldnt they sequence their greatest hits package just as well? They open with the classic "So whatcha want?" (1) and close with the unforgettable "Fight for Your Right (15)." In between you find them partying, dancing, and speaking to the city that birthed em (and this culture we live called hip hop). If you know the beasties and know what they are all about then you must pick this up and enjoy the fun of their carrer. If you dont know them, here is your chance to realize that they are some of the best to ever do it.      ',nonspam
' A1020L7BWW9RAX	B00085ETPE	January 9, 2006	0	1	4.0	Cot damn consciousness just does not show up like this no more!	 First I must state that this emcee is a friend of mine. Courage is an incredibly socially conscious emcee and he has a lot to say on his solo debut "The Art of Spiritual Warfare." Him and his Eastern Sunz crew rep for the politically minded in ways that I have not heard since the days of Public Enemy, way back in the late eighties. His style is a combination of many influences. You can feel the reggae influence in the music, you can feel the Talib Kweli and Chuck D. influence in the lyrics and his voice is all his own. This educated cat is speaking to us about everything that matters to him and should matter to the rest of us. The cool part is that he keeps your attention and commands that you pay him the respect of listening to what he has to say. Once you do you will learn a lot and you will be nodding your head at the same time because he has some amazing beats that just keep rocking even after multiple listens. This album is not the typical. He does not have one song that is not completely conscious. On "Ghost Dance" (6) he is speaking on the different ethnic groups that have been victims of genocide over the years, while he gets a little spiritual and reminiscent on "Three Spirits" (9). When you have an hour and a half sit down and listen for real because Courage has something to say and you owe him the listening because he delivers something that he believes in and is so educational if KRS had not already taken it this album would be called edutainment.

' A1020L7BWW9RAX	B000BBOVC6	January 6, 2006	1	3	4.0	This album is GOOD!!!	 Pharcyde has been around for a moment in this world of hip-hop and they have had their break ups and regrouping. Well the former leader of this fun crew of emcees has finally dropped his solo joint and I must say that he delivered a dope album. This thing is fresh, I dont care if the lead single came out 5 years ago or not. Everyone that is hating on the album because it took so long take one listen to "Writers Block" (9) and tell me that you are still mad at him. He put his heart and soul into this album and it shows. It has the typical funky and fun vibe of traditional Pharcyde all the while lyrical content that really is impressive for todays hip hop. He does not kill you with intelligent rhymes that are over your head, he just delivers every man, every day rap from the soul. He talks to his kids on "Dreams" (19), he tells the story of him and his girl on "The Story of Us" (11), and reintroduces himself over some crazy synth strings on the intro "Fat Leezy" (1). The one weak side to this album is a lot of the songs have cheesy choruses that bring it down at times, but overall this album is really dope and I wish I had discovered it sooner.      ',nonspam
' A1020L7BWW9RAX	B000AMU0UI	October 28, 2005	1	1	4.0	On the Real 3.5 Stars!	 Long before this album dropped I was talking with a friend and I said that I was worried about what this album would hold. Slug & Ant will always have a special place in my heart. They were, in a large part, what brought me into the so-called "underground" hip-hop scene. That being said I had to sit down and listen to this album many times to do it justice in words. Slug has never been a Rakim or Sage Francis, but he has been an above average emcee. Yes he talks about girls, and he has always known how to rock to Ants beats. He has always had something to say and a lot of the times the best results were the low key jams that his flow was almost him talking. On this album Ant produces some awesome beats that take some getting used to hearing Slug over. Every artist can evolve and what I see here is two individual artists who hit their peak together and are now working as one. Slug stepped up his flow on this album, he had to cause these beats are a sign of a new Ant, he went digging and has created some musical soundscapes that Atmosphere fans will not be used to. Luckily the new Ant gave birth to a new Slug as well who delivers some dope flows on tracks such as "Hockey Hair" (6) and the typical Lucy style rap "Pour Me Another" (8). He also pens an amazing verse that addresses the fan that was raped and murdered at an Albuquerque show in 2002. This album shows that while artistic evolution may hurt on a specific album, what is beginning here will prove to be very beneficial for their artistic output in the future.      ',nonspam

Combine the wonderful rhythms of funk, horns of jazz and some soul singing and what do you get. The positively glorious Breakestra! This album is just a bunch of fun. The lead man, Miles, has a great voice for what they are doing and the backing band can just jam! This project was spawned out of their performances at the root down in LA and if this is what they can do on an album I would be scarred to see them live. Not because they are bad but because they are so damn good! These guys are not looking to do anything but kick it and make some people party. The combination of Jazz, Blues, and Funk & Hip Hop is definitely proof positive that genres are meant to be destroyed. While there are a few tracks that are laid back this album is basically a party starter. On top of that it is full of old school breaks that those beat diggers will know automatically. Breakestra is just a wonderful album that needs to be heard by all! No hype, no BS just good tunes and a fun time, put it on and enjoy yourself!      ',nonspam
' A1020L7BWW9RAX	B00092ZKZO	October 22, 2005	3	4	4.0	"Always writing, Always Revising" This is Seattle Hip Hop!	 If ever two artists were supposed to be together in one group it is DJ/Producer Sabzi & Emcee Geologic. Geo fits Sabs beats like Snoop fits a Dre banger! Their style is all their own and a bit different from the rest of the Seattle hip hop you hear. They definitely are working mans hip-hop and they represent anyone who works hard at perfecting a trade. Their trade happens to be the art of rhyme and beat making and they are pretty good at it. As I listen to this album I find Geologics voice entrancing and very smooth. Sabzi produces very musical beats that have you instantly nodding your head. Geos style is pointed towards hard work and his familys history, and Seattles. They rep home pretty heavily, shouting out 7th & Jackson and on Evening Chai (9) he gives you the low down on whats been happening in Sea Town for ages. This album just rocks all the way through to the end and when its finished you want to play it again. This is where you find its one flaw: it does not have terrific replay value. Its good, dont get me wrong its damn good, but after 10 15 listens it seems boring and you want more. I over look this fact being as it is their debut and it is so amazing those first 15 times.

Michael Franti & Spearhead have been doing this music thing for a minute and this album is just more of their wonderful blend of politically charged lyrics, funky rhythms & awesome grooves. Franti is a wonderful lyricist who knows how to write a song that is good and gets a message across without sounding like he is preaching. His style of rapping is very cool and a different feel for anybody who is tired of the same old same old style that seems to be all over MTV and mainstream radio today. You find yourself bobbing your head to the whole album just because it is that good. He can sing as well and play the guitar throwing in some nice little riffs in the songs to make them his own. As you listen you cant help but feel like if Bob Marley and Public Enemy had a child Michael Franti & Spearhead would be it, and everyone deserves that music for sure!      ',nonspam
' A1020L7BWW9RAX	B000B9EYDY	October 13, 2005	1	1	4.0	An intriquing mix of Comics & Rap??	 MF Doom is a character, literally! He can join the Monsta Island Czars as King Greedorah, he can travel through time as the mad Scientist Viktor Vaughn, and now he can team up with Dangermouse to become Danger Doom! When I first heard about this collabo I was convinced it would be another epic album just like the Doom and Madlib "Madvillian" album, but sadly that is not the case. While I was not looking for a remake I was hoping for something reminiscent of what they created. Instead you get something that is completely different and in the end that is what makes Doom so damn good! He releases multiple albums a year and he never sounds repetitive. He always comes with the new hotness. That hotness is due, in large part to Dangermouse who crafts some mesmerizing musical soundscapes. Such as the Cee-Lo assisted "Benzie Box", the beat, some intense drums and what sounds like static and some haunting keys, just put you in a trance. That is what Dangermouse seems to have mastered. He can create the most simplistic of beats that actually are not simplistic at all. He layers sounds like non other and actually allows the song to develop. Lyrically you really know what to expect, more of that Doom madness that just keeps coming and always sounds sick. The guests are top notch and I havent heard Ghostface sound so good with another emcee since the days him and Raekwon were making Cuban Linx. Every track on "The Mouse & The Mask" flows together and it makes you wonder if Danger Doom really is a superhero here to resurrect hip-hop.      ',nonspam
' A1020L7BWW9RAX	B00004XSI1	October 4, 2005	0	0	4.0	An interesting Album that impresses if you let it!	 How do you begin this review? Everlast started out in House of Pain back in the day and then when they dropped off the face of the earth Everlast came with a blues/rock album that received a fair amount of praise. Then there was this, his sophomore effort. While not a bad album it does not always flow that smoothly. He opens with "Whitey" an interesting intro that you could totally see Bubba Sparxxx tear apart, but in all fairness this is the only time that Everlast sounds good over a beat on the album. The rest of the album goes back and forth between guitar based tracks and more traditional rap tracks. His style of rapping over rock beats has been done before but he sounds better than most.  He is at his best playing a mellow blues riff and kind of half singing half rapping his verses. This album is by no means bad and actually it is pretty good but he should have ditched the rapping altogether, even if Kurupt sounds damn good on their duet "One, Two (12)."      ',nonspam
' A1020L7BWW9RAX	B000AMJDDI	October 1, 2005	0	3	4.0	Give it up one more time for the Quanum Crew!!	 Gift of Gab & Chief Xcel are back and they just keep on pushing the boundaries. The Craft is their third full-length album and the live instrumentation that the Chief introduced to us on Blazing Arrow is in full effect here. Every song is a journey and they all flow together like one long song. Gift touches on several topics in his usual style: dropping poetical lyrics that 99% of the other emcees out wish they could think of. He speaks on the issues with prisons in America not doing their job of rehabilitation on "The Rise & Fall of Elliott Brown" (10). "Ego Sonic War Drums" (13) is an amazing track that speaks on the political state of the country and world we are living in, and the drums on the track really do make you think of marching into battle! But the overall feeling of this album is exactly what the title says "The Craft" and gab has several tracks that he speaks about this art or rhyme that he practices but the chorus to the title track says it all: "This craft/this beat/this rhyme/this vibe/this style/they say music gives new life/from a source inside that is forever flowin/this stage/this mic/this crowd/this show/this life/Ive been givin a gift tonight/& for that I vow to be a vessel."

' A1020L7BWW9RAX	B00004SDQ2	September 28, 2005	0	1	3.0	Why does it sound so repetitive?	 Dilated has been around for a minute and this album was their introduction to the world outside of the LA underground. Consisting of Rakka Iriscience, Evidence & DJ Babu (of the legendary Beat Junkies) this album has all the elements of a classic boom bap hip hop record: Bangin beats, elevated lyrics, & scratches that just seem to be perfect. Given all of this how could I possibly rate it so harshly? Basically each song is great on its own but if you try to listen to it as a whole it seems tedious, repetitive and almost boring! Rakka and Ev are both top caliber emcees and they come strong on this album, but it is defiantly Rakka who grabs your attention with his almost off beat flow and deep voice. Babu does an amazing job crafting beats that like I said hark back to the days of boom bap like few producers can. Add his precise cuts and scratches and he might just come across as a genius. This album is not terrible and definitely worth checkin for, especially considering their truly bad album that was released last year "Neighborhood Watch." This album is not bad just too much of the same!      ',nonspam
' A1020L7BWW9RAX	B000283OA8	September 26, 2005	2	2	4.0	The Grime will grow on you!	 If you were coming here looking for a rap album turn around right now unless you have an open mind when it comes to music. Dizzee makes what they call Grime music over their across the pond. It is an interesting amalgam of rap, garage, & house. Lyrically Dizzee is a trip. He has a lot to say and the fact that he can flow to these beats is really impressive. His accent adds that extra touch to his songs that make them sound good. He addresses a lot of topics ranging from partying to growing up in the hoods in London (the LD as he calls it). While he is rapping, his beats are like nothing you have heard over here, unless you are a major techno fan. They definitely have the electronic edge to them. While I enjoy the sounds I find it hard to listen to at times because they are so sporadic and jumpy. There are the mellow tracks which are a nice break but overall this album is a straight up party from start to finish so if you are wanted to just chill throw something else on, but if you want to get wild then let Dizzee Rascal pump out of your speakers!

' A1020L7BWW9RAX	B000067CLT	September 25, 2005	0	0	5.0	Wow! This is beautiful	 How do you begin to write about such an impressive album? Released on Rawkus before they fell apart, before Mos went to Rock to express himself, and before Tallib tried to go commercial, during what could be called the peak of the underground.  This was just two guys with a passion for dope beats and fluid rhymes. They introduce themselves over hypnotic keys & subtle drums from Evil Dee with the beautiful "Astronomy (8th Light)." "Definition "and "Re: Definition" are two cuts that demonstrate both emcees lyrical skills and Mos early desire to branch out to other genres, he sings the oh so memorable chorus. "Childrens Story" is the most obvious tribute to the golden era, as its a cover of the classic Slick Rick cut, but throughout the album any hip hop head will catch the numerous references, both lyrically and musically, to that time in hip hop. J. Rawls delivers the stunning "Brown Skin Lady" while Mos & Kweli speak about the beauty of woman, more specifically the beauty of  those "brown skin ladies" out their. They get intellectual on "K.O.S. (Determination)" over a very mellow beat and a wonderful chorus sung by Vinia Majica, if this song does not make you want to strive for knowledge of self then I doubt anything will! The album finishes up extremely strong with a posse cut that showed off the Rawkus stable (what happen there?) and then goes to one of the greatest songs ever "Thieves in the Night". Not much can be said about this song other than it is pretty much perfect from what they have to say to the beat to how they flow over the beat, all just amazing. The album finishes up with "Respiration" which features Common and by the end you may just be speechless & in need of respiration. This album shows how great hip hop can be and why we need to support it till death do us part.      ',spam
' A1020L7BWW9RAX	B000A9QKCS	September 15, 2005	1	2	5.0	hip hop thats fun, inteligent & you can dance to it?	 Lots of talk and speculation but whats the deal about this crew outta NC called The Justus League? They are taking this hip-hop back to the days when hip-hop was fun and had meaning! This is what hip-hop is all about right here. 9th Wonder, Big Pooh & Phonte just know how to put it down and they do not compromise themselves one bit (which is nice to see from a major label). I know that 9th has been sounding a little tired as of late but he was just saving it for his boys. He worked in a real studio this time around and it shows. His samples are tighter, his drums hit crisper & the overall sound is warmer. Phonte and Big Pooh are both still evolving lyricists, but at the same time they are very precise with their words and flow. They are kept on their toes by the young bucks in their crew who they have guest on this album. Joe Scudda continues to impress me with his verse on "Love It" and Darien Brockington needs to teach these so called R&B cats out today what real soul music is. You find lots of subjects touched on, but it is always second to the overall theme of the album, which is trying to show the world that hip-hop is dope beats & dope rhymes about something, and above all its about having fun. We have lost that in a lot of todays big hip hop stars and Little Bro gets props for taking a stand on something they believe in.  I loved "The Listening" and did not expect them to top it but the more I hear this album the more I think they may have. It is not that "The Listening" was a bad album so much as this album is just more whole. I find it having a familiar feeling. It almost seems like you have been listening to it for years and you just copped it yesterday.      ',spam

I was slightly skeptical about it prior to the release and then all the reviews started coming out saying it was amazing. I was not fully convinced until my man, who did not like College Dropout, told me it was "an instant Classic." If he thought it was that dope then I had to check it out and here I am 48 hours latter still vibeing to it. Kanye and Jon Brion hooked up and did something magical Id say. We have all heard Kanyes beats and seen his arrogant, egotistical self act a fool on TV and while Im not a big fan of him as a person he pulled something off that is quite promising of hip hops future: He made a hip hop album that is musical, socially relevant & sells. I guess that means that we will have to put up with his arrogant ass for that much longer. Being the sophomore album he pulled out all the tricks, bringing in an indie rock producer to help with orchestration, thats right Kanye still has all those samples but hes got strings, flutes, horns etc. on this album and its live! As you listen to the album you feel the emotion & energy that Kanye has for this music. He loves hip hop so much that he cant be bound down by the so called strict standards that plague hip hop today. Lyrically he actually is solid. Of course hes brought in guests that are better than him but its a beautiful thing to here Jay rhyme & then here Nas kick a verse on the next song, the epic "We Major". Paul Wall rides the beat to "Drive Slow" with out flaw and CamRon continues his string of guest verses that are dope (keep it up and real heads might be checkin cam!) He solidifies himself as the best producer doin it (sorry Just) and shows us that reality, while not always pretty, can be entertaining and that a rap album can speak on real subjects & still be fun.

Motown was one of the most successful labels in the history of recorded music and they always had that funky music to vibe to. Well a group of todays best DJs and producers have gotten unlimited access to the Motown vaults and this is the result. Absolutely amazing backing tunes that pay tribute to the originals and mix them up at the same time. Z-Trip does an amazing job of incorporating the original vibe of "I Want You Back" while still making it sound like the Jackson family just went to the studio and laid down the vocals yesterday. The Randy Watson Experience is headed by the Roots genius ?uestlove and includes James Poyser (Common, Roy Hargrove) on the B3, and they take over Gladys Knight & The Pips "I Heard It Through The Grapevine" with a full set of live instruments; its like the funky brothers never left! The last track that I want to mention is the one that I was most looking forward to. Its by the one and only DJ Jazzy Jeff! He teams up with Pete Kuzma to deliver an almost nine minute jam of the Temptations "Papa Was a Rolling Stone". Now if you have heard any of Jazzs recent stuff (not the fresh prince) then you know that this is gonna be beautiful. He does not disappoint one bit, with the original horns still their but distorted slightly. He adds some funky bass lines and of course the Temps are always amazing and this song is no different. Not to forget the other 12 songs on this album they all have their own distinctive vibe that is both modern and old at the same time. Absolutely beautiful music for your listening enjoyment in the 2 double 0 5!!      ',nonspam

(3.5 Stars)	 1999: LA based label Stones Throw releases the debut group album "Soundpices" from Lootpack, a group that consists of emcee/producer Madlib, emcee Medaphor, & DJ Romes. "Soundpices" goes on to become a modern day classic and Stones Throw develops into one of the premier independent hip hop labels. 2005: Madlib is an elite & prolific producer consistently delivering classic or near classic material. Medaphor has changed his name to M.E.D. and putting in work with guest spots on numerous Stones Throw projects and is now ready to drop his debut album "Push Comes to Shove." With eighteen tracks, thirteen produced by Madlib, two produced by Oh No, two produced by Dilla, and one produced by the one and only Just Blaze (yes indeed!!) you know that this album is gon be fire musically. Lyrically this album is only a solid effort. Its obvious that M.E.D has skills and if all the mainstream spit like him than hip hop today would be a whole other story. His flow is choppy and sporadic. He can only really ride to beats that are the same: choppy, and not always easy on the ears. This is the problem with the album. He has amazing melodic beats that unfortunatley he cant do justice to. Their are a couple of tracks that he rides to a tee (dillas Push) but overall most of these amazing beats go to waste. I dont mean to sound like this album is terrible but if he coulda got some beats that fit his style more it would have come off better. But honestly who is checkin for Stones Throw projects because they want amazing, elevating lyrics? We all know that Stones Throw has a stable of competent emcees and amazing beat makers and thats what we all want to hear: That new crazy Madlib (...), which we get in abundance here.      ',nonspam

"Be" is just that, music for your soul, music for your brain, music that lets you just be. Common has always been a dope emcee, we all know that but something is always missing. "Electric Circus" was missing the rapping, "Like Water For Chocolate" was missing No ID. What is "Be" missing? Absolutley nothing. Common and Kanye connect and unite chi-town and deliver possibly the best hip hop album of the year. The album has all the magic that ol skool hip hop albums have, the days when it was one producer and one emcee. Granted Jay Dee (know Dilla) does do two tracks but they flow perfectly fine with Kanyes old soul vibes. Kanye shows a side of him that has been hinted at but never fully explored, until now that is. He uses lives instruments mixed with several soul samples to create modern day soul. This is what makes "Be" an amazing album: It has soul. You can feel the emotion that Common raps with, you can feel the power in Kanyes samples and drums, you can feel the soul in James Poyser keys. Its all real, true MUSIC. Lyrically it should go without saying that the whole album is on point. Common always puts it down for the fans of true poets, and he does it again on "Be". This album is pure and you owe it to yourself to realize like Common does on the title track that "the present is a gift & i just want to be."      ',spam

C-Rayz comes through on this album with a mix of beats that show the second coming of Def Jux. Most of the producers are cats that Ive never heard of but I think that we will all be checkin for em after listening to this album. The lyrical topics he touches on is wide. He discusses the problems with race and skin color in this hip hop game on "Blackout". He and Vordul Mega get gully on "Street Reppin". Then he flips it and attacks all the wannabe gangstas out their on "Pink". He does not let up once on the album always spittin that raw and real sh*t for ya brain, and overall he succeeds in continuing the monstrous year that Def Jux is having by delivering an album that will make it onto several top ten year end lists      ',spam

First lets explain who this high pitched rhymer really is and who he is down with. The crazy beat conductor Madlib is here all over the place whether its the typical blunted out Madlib beats, which once again prove that hes the greatest diggin producer around. Or maybe `Lib drops some jewels with his typical laid back flow that almost sounds like he is just talking. Then of course theres the Lord. Quas is in and out on every track, probably due to takin hits between bars. Along with the typical genius that you get with Madlib you also get a few guest to come through and "Closer" is an amazing reunion of Madvillain, with MF Doom reuniting with Quas so the two can trade bars. Overall most of the album is just Quas and `Lib tradin off and on with lots of instrumental breaks and some crazy obscure vocal samples. No hooks, no crunk, just that pure and uncut Madlib funk that you only get from lots of bong hits and thousands of old records, enjoy!      ',nonspam

But this album is about so much than politics; it is about some great music and helping a good cause. You see, the proceeds that are generated from this album are being donated to the Rainforest Action Network (RAN) as to try and save our world through the grassroots efforts, since it seems that mainstream paths do not want to work. Secondly although this album is called a hip hop album it is really just a compilation album full of some great emcees and some amazing soulful artists. This is what hip hop started as: Old school soul mixed with some new flavor. Whether you are looking for some straight up hip hop, soul, funk, or great music this album has it all. Antibalas comes through with some awesome jazzyness (P.A. 2 #11) for you to enjoy and the Poets of Rhythm (funk group) drop a great cut that just flows and is full of life (Flight To St. Vincent #7). This album not only shows that their still are some good musicians in the world but that there are still people in the music industry that care more about the state of the world rather than money for their pocket!

Lyrics Born has been makin moves for years on the hip hop scene and now he drops an album that branches out to some other styles. While its still same ol same ol Quannum with Jumbo, Xcel, & Shadow on most of the beats he branches out and works with several new people such as Evidence (Dilated Peoples), KRS-One, E-40, & Herio alum Casual, plus the typical quannum cats Lateef & his wife Joyo Velarde. If you dont know LB, then let me say he likes to fuse multiple genres together and form some crazy bumpin music. Wether its some bluesly/reggae music (Over You #10) or some raw funkyness (Stop Complaining #15) he mixes it up well all the while droping consistent hot lines. All of the music on this album is impressive even if some of it is not your typical hip hop beats. LB is no slack on the mic either, his flow is always changing and he always has something to say. On "Im Just Raw" (4) he comes with the raw battle rhymes that so many emcees forget about once they make it. LB has the album open with two Jumbo bangers (Oregon!!!) and i will just say that i can not wait for the next Lifesavas album cause these beats are awesome and the emcees do not disappoint, most definetly the two best beats on the album. Latryx comes together for the remix of "The Last Trumpet" which is an amazing song with some very importent lyrics.

' A1020L7BWW9RAX	B00070G74G	April 19, 2005	1	1	4.0	Is Def Jux tryin to branch out?	 For those that dont know Boston is home to more than Benzino and a corrupt hip hop mag. The mighty Bean-Town is home to Akrobatik, Mr.Lif, & DJ Fakts One all who are respected solo artists but together form the Perceptionists a union that has been a long time coming and does not disappoint. Actually it is a bit surprising for a Def Jux release. All the beats are much more straight forward and almost all of them are banging in different ways, even El-P switched up his style and laced three of the tracks with some funkiness. If you are at all familiar with either of the emcees in this group you know that lyrics will be in abundance. They an emcees emcee and they spend the whole album dropping hot lines for everyone to enjoy over and over again. Along with Ak and Lif tearing it up you have Boston legend Guru bless "Party Hard" with his amazing flow, even if he is monotone. This album is just a wonderful ride all the way through and definitely should make it on to the year end top tens.      ',nonspam

I have gone back and coped the albums from hip hops "Golden Age". Blueprint is a true b-boy, he knows his history and he aint afraid to show it. Blueprint covers all the topics from 88 whether its political consciousness (Liberated), battle raps (1988), story telling (Inner City Native Son) or the braggadocio that so many of those original emcees had. Along with the lyrics prints got the beats to and he delivers an album that shows plenty of influences form the golden age but still includes the modern day twist on it. This album is fluid and amazing. Sitting here listening to it now I realize that compared to current hot albums this album is ages ahead even though he went ages behind to create it, a true masterpiece.      ',nonspam

They are also joined by bass player Rob Castro who produces one track and lays bass lines down on other tracks. These two emcees both with Latino heritage create an album that is both bumpin and interesting. Due to their cultural ties they deliver songs that speak on ancient rituals and spirits just as much as they are talking about Seattle and how they are super heroes here to save hip hop. They are here to save hip hop with some real lyrics that are more than just dealing drugs and gang banging. Having been around for awhile now they brought in underground heavy hitters Canibus, Aesop Rock, and Mr.Lif to name a few guests and they hold their own next to these lyrical geniuses. The beats are all dark and have a very special feel especially if you have spent any time in Seattle. They harnessed that dreary feeling that looms over the city more days then I care to count and delivered and very good hip hop album not just for Seattle artists but for hip hop in general.

R&B singers fit into two categories: Either they dont really have any talent but they have slammin bodies or they have amazing talent and maybe not quite the supermodel body. Cherokee does not show off her body here to much but she does show off her vocal cords some and she really shows of some talented writing skills approaching a lot of subjects that stay in the background. On "Stepping Stone" (5) she talks about a woman who is continuously verbally abused by her man but she keeps taking it until she finally has gained enough "strength to carry on." The music is all top notch with a band playing some blues, some jazz, and a little bit of funk. Her voice is very cool but I dont think that she has the pipes of some singers but this is ok cause what she does with her voice works perfectly well and leaves very little to be desired. If you are looking for an album with an honest singer and some funky tunes then go no further than Cherokees "I Love you...Me."      ',nonspam
' A1020L7BWW9RAX	B00004SCCO	March 24, 2005	0	3	2.0	RIP Big Pun (2.5 Stars)	 Posthumous albums are funny things. Few artists recorded like `Pac. That man lived in the studio if he was not in jail. Big pun released one album while alive and it is supposed to be a classic in the truest since of the word. I cant comment on that album cause I have never heard it but this album is fairly simplistic overall. The two skits are just bad. Then two of his Terror Squanders basically get solo tracks: Tony Sunshine with "My D**k" and Remy Martin with "Ms. Martin", so right their your down to only 12 songs that actually have Pun rapping, and this is suppose to be his album? If you throw all the guests in that number gets almost cut in half so overall you have a compilation album with Big Pun and lots of guests. Now sometimes this does not matter but the only great guests are M.O.P., true prospect shows some promise on "Off wit his head"  and Cuban link is aight but basically the terror squad had one great rapper, Pun himself, and lots of mediocre rappers. This album is laced with some nice Latino beats which means that you can at least here the wackness being backed by some good soundscapes. The one thing I will say that when Big Pun is on he is on his flow and lyrics can be spectacular. One example of this is "We Dont Care", for such a big man to have that great of breath control is very impressive since Ive heard people that are much smaller than him not be able to flow that well. So overall I would say check his debut and if you see this album used then maybe cop it otherwise its not worth it.      ',nonspam
' A1020L7BWW9RAX	B000007TE8	March 23, 2005	0	1	3.0	Could of been so much more lyrically (Still a dope record)	 Hip Hops drunken frat boys are back and they are growing up...sort of. "Hello Nasty" finds MCA, Adrock, & Mike D discovering more styles of music to mess around with and steer away from the drunken rhymes of such seminal albums as their debut "Licensed to Ill". Instead they seem to be talking in rhyme about a whole lot of nothing a lot of the time. They are saying stuff but it is kind of subliminal and not direct. I guess this is my beef with the album while it sounds tight throughout and is worth bumping over a lot of todays hip hop this album generally is not saying anything. I have to respect the beasties for continuing & advancing in a genre where most groups that have been around for twelve plus years are still doing the same things they did at the beginning of their career. The music on this album is pretty amazing throughout and the instrumentals placed on the album are really sick. I guess I would have expected that with all their statements about politics and how bad they feel about their misogynistic lyrics of the past they would have included some of that on here. Either way they dropped yet another groundbreaking album for hip hop and it is definitely worth checking out.      ',nonspam
' A1020L7BWW9RAX	B0002IQHU2	March 22, 2005	3	4	4.0	Raw & Uncut Boom Bap Hip Hop (3.5 Stars)	 Philly outfit Jedi Mind Tricks bring the hardcore boom bap hip hop to the forefront with this their fourth effort. While Vinnie Paz has always a lyrical gangsta with hints of philosopher, historian, and theologian he continues the trend here with mixed results. While I do not agree with his homophobia his comments on Christianity and the misconceptions about Islam are well placed. His voice is slightly grating on the ears but generally his lyrics are sick enough to take away from the gruffness of it. Just look to "The Age of Sacred Terror", track 2, to see examples of all his sides and put on display along with tight lyrics: It is the age of the sacred terror/a communist revolutionary Che Guevara. Listen close and you will find lots of little lines that are demonstrate his prowess on the mic. The other half of JMT is Stoupe the enemy of mankind and if he keeps makin beats like he has been on all the JMT albums hes gon be the envy of all producers out there. His beats are just beautiful. Some are operatic, some are Latin influenced and some are just breathtaking. He layers all the sounds together so well that you dont want it to stop, and with this release he felt inclined to give us some snippets of other beats as interludes and they are all amazing in and of themselves. If you have been looking for an indy group that has a feel of the mainstream then JMT is your group, and "Legacy of Blood" is the album you need to cop.      ',nonspam

This album is Alias second, and first instrumental project. True he has laid down beats for most of the anticon associates over the years but this is just him making some amazing beats. Alias generally goes for the spooky and ominous sounds maybe with some grainy vocals cut in to the track as well. In the vein of RJD2 or Odd Nosdam (another anticon instrumentalist), this album flows from beginning to end with some samples for the true beat digger to decipher, two guest lyricists, and lots of drums and synths. I do not really now how to describe this album other than to say that it is amazing. Alias has done something special here that needs to be heard by the world so buy a copy for you and a copy for a friend, they will love it.      ',nonspam
' A1020L7BWW9RAX	B000008TV3	March 21, 2005	1	1	4.0	Where are they now? (4.5 stars actually)	 Female R&B groups always draw comparisons to the same artists: Destinys Child and TLC. Well this group of four talented singers started at the same time as DC and is on a much different vibe as TLC. Four singers all with voices that could bring the roof down and some really smooth hip hop styled R&B production. After listening to this album I have to ask myself what is it that made DC blow up and keep these girls from making a second album together. Most of the time when I pick up an R&B CD I figure it to be some cookie cutter BS but on here you get some ladies that just want to sing about love and their men. Not the most groundbreaking of topics but they do it with class and the music that back em is great. The four interludes throughout the album hold it back a little bit from flowing perfectly but the two emcees that stop in for guest spots come correct. So once again I ask why did a group with so much potential not make it out the box? They even have one of puff daddys "Hitmen" on board as executive producer. If solid lyrics, great voices, and good music (for this type of R&B) does not sell you to MTV I do not know what would.      ',nonspam

Last year the dropped their first group album in several years and it was met with only luke warm results. Now a year later they drop a 15 track deep album with all 9 emcees and dubbed it classic because they new what they were making was real. Although the first song is simply titled "Intro" it is so much more than your typical rap album intro skit with an amazing beat and some sick lyrics. This is the formula throughout the album: amazing beats and sick lyrics. All the 9 of the guys drop dope verbals for ya to devour. A lot of the production is kept in house but they do branch out some with Madlib stopping through and DJ Khalil doing a track. If you dig real beats and some simple man rap then be sure to check this album the first classic album of the 2 double oh 5.      ',nonspam
' A1020L7BWW9RAX	B0002DSCF0	March 20, 2005	2	2	4.0	Amazing....just amazing.... (4.5 Stars actually)	 For a man to go from an instrumental hip hop album to this, which is quite the opposite, and do them both almost perfectly is very interesting. While Wales project as Science Fiction received a lot of critical acclaim for his amazing musical collages this album here is just Wale performing everything. All the instruments & vocals were done by him except on the few tracks with verses from some amazing emcees. Wale is from Nigeria and you get that African feel on a most of these tracks, whether it is from his voice or from his drum patterns that he creates. The intro track is amazing even if it is not even 2 minutes long. That is a problem on a lot of this album the songs you want to be longer are incredibly short. Wale is singing on this album and his voice is very interesting. Unlike a lot of singers today he actually has a voice that he can use as an instrument which proves to be very nice. His lyrics range from politics to love to life and they are all backed by some amazing sounds. The three emcees he recruits are perfect for this project and while they dominate the tracks they are on they do not take away from the whole Wale Oyejide experience throughout the album. If you looking for some smooth mellow music to have in the background or if you in just one of those odd moods put this in your deck, it is guaranteed to bring a smile to your face and make you problems disappear (at least for the duration of the album).

' A1020L7BWW9RAX	B00070HA1K	March 14, 2005	0	2	3.0	A great intro to million $ dream!	 Although this is credited as a Nickpeace album, it is really just a compilation album to show off his label Million Dollar Dream. With fifteen tracks, three being instrumental interludes you get a solid album with very few missteps. They are not the most lyrical of artists or the most creative of rappers but they have a style and they do it very well. Most of the artists here have been around for along time with devoted followings especially in the bay area. Brotha Lynch Hung comes through on the track "Aint not the bay", which as you can tell is all about people thinkin that Sac town is the same as the bay area. The legend Mac Dre has a track on here, which sadly does not live up to his potential, but since his passing it is probably hard to find tracks that are unreleased by him. The Nocturnal Hustlers have one of the sickest tracks on here with "Rip Tracks" (12) but most of the songs are solid and worth a spin or two. I do not know how many of these artists are on Million Dollar Dream but this definitely makes you want to check for most of the artists that make an appearance. Nickpeace does a good job of releasing a sampler of what to expect from his label in 2005 and beyond.      ',nonspam
' A1020L7BWW9RAX	B000795LT4	March 9, 2005	3	3	4.0	Solid Debut from some talented artists	 Aloe Blacc & Exile? They come together and create Emanon. I dont now too much about them but they dropped a pretty good debut album with "The Waiting Room." Most of the beats are raw and organic but scaled down. Not a lot of layers just some tight keys and a drum beat, maybe some strings or a vocal sample thrown in. Now this may sound simplistic but in a day and age when a lot of indy folks are creating massively complex beats this is a likeable change. Aloe is the Emcee & Singer and Exile is the beat creator. Aloe is a tight emcee who drops knowledge on tracks like "Politician" and "Six Million Ways." He also has a voice that beats most of todays R&B singers, and he just does it for fun. Exile is a producer in the vein of Premo but with a modern day feel to his style. Two of the tracks (The World Dont Sing & A Story) fall flat for me. While "The World Dont Sing" makes since in context with the track that follows (Politician), it is just feels out of place. "A Story" might be just that but the combination of the beat and Aloes flow just ruins it for me. For a debut full length this album shows promise for these two up and comers and it is definitely good enough to make you want to check out their back catalog and any future releases.      ',nonspam
' A1020L7BWW9RAX	B0007KTBEE	March 7, 2005	0	0	4.0	If only he had some better emcees! (3.5 Stars)	 Chicago has been doing some big things on the hip hop tip lately and here is the latest from the windy city. For a debut album he shows off his production skills quite well, while putting his emcee duties on the back burner. Instead he pulls in a bunch of mostly unknown cats to rip it over his amazing beats. These guys dont do a bad job but they are not on the same caliber of most of his musical offerings. The intro track is just a moody instrumental with some really perfect samples scratched in for added effect. On the posse cut "Dreams" (5), Diverse continues spittin pure fire just like he did on his solo debut. He is joined by Longshot and Profound, two other rappers that hold their own. Boston legend Edo G comes in for a solid track with "TakeNOver" (16) and Copperpot constructs a Pete Rock esque beat for him to tear apart. This album has one major flaw: While the emcees are not weak most of them do not do Copperpots beats justice. He has constructed some of the better beats for an indy album in awhile but they are laced with rappers that either need help with flow or content (battle raps are tight in a battle, not on an album). If youre a beat fiend check this album if you like thought provoking lyrics go pick up Qwels album.      ',nonspam

On Bazooka Tooth his intense lyrics were back by Ace newly developed production that was too much for what he had to say. On this album he is back with Blockhead and he has mellowed out his production style. You get the typical Ace Rizzle here along with a few guests such as El-P and CamuTao on Rickety Rackety. Aesop attacks the Catholic Church on Holy Smokes but does so fashionably and brings up some good points. On Food, Cloths, Medicine he is at his best production wise and beat wise with some tight samples. If you are looking for something to hold you over till the next full length then this album will do it and then some. Plus by getting the book "The Living Human Curiosity Sideshow" which contains all his lyrics from the albums Float, Labor Days, Daylight, Bazooka Tooth, & Fast Cars, Danger, Fire, & Knives you can not go wrong with this purchase      ',nonspam

John Legend the Debut artist from Kanyes GOOD music imprint is a classically trained pianist and an amazing singer. A quick glance at the liner notes shows that Legend co-produced every track and wrote all his own lyrics. This is definitely the sign of an artist who wants to control his career and make it a long lasting one. Used To Love U (3) is a really awesome song that has a perfect sample in it to make both the club and the bedroom hype. That is the general vibe of this whole album. Legend mixes old school soul with modern day hip-hop sounds to deliver a very impressive R&B album. Mostly upbeat love songs, but thanks to the Kanye touch they stand out from the typical. The beautiful ballad "Ordinary People" is just amazing, just Legend on the keys and vocals. The guests are kept to a minimum. Of course Kanye has to pop in for an appearance but he spits his typical plain man rap and the Big Boss Dog Snoop stops in for a smoothed out verse on "I Can Change" which has Snoop saying he will give it all up for one woman. The terrific Miri Ben-Ari also has a few spots on here with her violin. If you are looking for a new version of the Ol School soul that your folks have in their record crates then this is the album for you.      ',nonspam

All the greats have released em and they all have the same result: Good but would be classic if cut down to one disc. Nas has been getting closer and closer to another Illmatic album since the summer of 2001 and his battle against then king of NYC Jay-Z. Then in the summer of 2002 he went crazy and went at everybody. His moms died and he chilled out a little bit and released his second best album (Gods Son). Now hes back with a nod to the first lines he ever spite on wax: "Streets Disciple/My raps are trifle". With those words he built a buzz that has yet to be matched. With this his eighth album he shows us that he is finally grown up and happy. Nas is goin at the government, the "Uncle Toms" and the rappers that are ruining this art form. At the same time he is settling down (him and Kelis were married a few weeks ago). He is no longer the young and dumb rapper; he is the elder statesman that is tryin to find a balance. He is the Streets Disciple and unlike Jay he aint retiring.      ',nonspam

The clan has been around for a decade plus and they are still banging. RZA created a new form of sampling and as a collective they were insane. From solo classics to the four full lengths that they dropped it was all amazing. This album starts off with C.R.E.A.M., quite possibly one of the best tracks ever. And it just keeps going. All the hits are here as are a few of the not so famous songs. You get a few rare tracks from soundtracks or from one of the many Wu-Tang side projects and they hold their own with the rest of the tracks. And just to show how classic their debut was half of the "36 Chambers" is here so all you old school heads can hit that up whenever you want. It is hard to create best of records especially for a group like the Wu but they did a good job here. Now if they would just give us a complete box set of every thing (yeah right!!).      ',spam

Its been three years since Sages last official album and several tours. While "Personal Journals" was just that: personal, "A Healthy Distrust" is a bit more political and more of Sages great poetics. On "Gunz Yo" you here a battle ready Sage with one-liners like "Youre dead like De La. I hold my crotch like a 9 MM. Gunz Yo!" On "Escape Artist" Sage tries the triple time flow and does it amazingly, this is probably the best track on the album. Being that Sage is a lover of all music he teams up with Indy Rocker Will Oldham for "Sea Lion", and dedicates a track to the late, great Johnny Cash with "Jah Didnt Kill Johnny." The beats are more of that typical anticon style. Alias puts in a lot of work and they are all dope. The legendary Dangermouse (Grey Album fame) puts in a track, as does Reanimator. All you Non Prophets heads out there Joe Beats gives us the beat to the one interlude on the album. Overall Sage delivers a great album early in the year that easily will keep Sage name at the top of all the best emcee lists.      ',nonspam

That is the best thing I can say about this album and since it is Dangermouse (Grey Album Fame) who produced this album I would expect no less. DM has an uncanny ability of finding some really amazing samples and throwing them into beats to craft something never heard before. The title track is a perfect example; DM samples some chanting harmonies that work perfect with the drums and creates a haunting track. Every track on this album is the result of some kind of crazy sample that is flipped perfectly into a beat that Jemini flows to perfectly. Jemini is not a terrific emcee but he is by now means a terrible emcee. He has his moments but when combined with Prince Po or J-Zone it is hard not to be upstaged. He does drop some knowledge on (...) and "Bush Boys". Hes got the braggadocio of typical Brooklyn emcees and demonstrates it on "The Only One" and "Omega Supreme". If you are looking for an album that can be played in the club and for the backpackers, for the intelligent heads and the ones who could care less about the lyrics, you have found the right album and it is all thanks to Dangermouse spectacular auditory creations.

Was I wrong. She is one of very few young women singer/songwriters that chooses to be backed by a band instead of some flossy hip-hop production. Rebekah is a very good singer with a great voice and her songs are well written. Each track on this album is different. None of them sound the same, even though they do revolve around a few key topics. The title track is a great song with her band putting together a great track. Her band seems to be just a collection of studio musicians who know what they are doing and this is demonstrated by the fact that her bass player is Mike Elizondo, who currently is Dr.Dres go to man for any bass lines he might need. Rebekah unfortunately did not really have a chance to be successful. Our society does not seem to appreciate female singers who are not singing cheesy pop love ballads over some synths and a repetitive drum track. If you are looking for a good singer that youve probably never heard of check this album out you will not be disappointed.      ',nonspam
' A1020L7BWW9RAX	B000084T3J	January 16, 2005	3	3	4.0	Jazz with a Hip Hop Touch	 Hip Hop has always been connected to Jazz, weather it was Tribe back in the early nineties, Madlib today or any other producer you can think of chances are they have used some Jazz at some point in their career. Well with this album you get a traditional Jazz trumpeter composing and arranging a straight up Jazz album with a taste of that Hip Hop spirit. Weather its the "Common Freestyle" or Q-Tip on "Poetry" this Jazz album has just the right amount of Hip Hop to please B-Boys along with the real Jazz fans. Those are just the two tracks with emcees on them. Several other tracks stand out with some great singers performing. The epic "Ill Stay" makes you wonder where DAngelo has been and on "Forget Regret" Stephanie McKay makes you want to find her solo CD and hope that the RH Factor backs it. This album is an impressive mix of Jazz with Hip Hop and if you are a Hip Hop head looking for an introduction to Jazz then this is the album for you. If you are a Jazz fan that has always been disgusted with Hip Hops connection with Jazz hopefully this will show you what its all about: Good Music.      ',nonspam

Baltimore is not known for a strong hip-hop scene, but if you know anything about B-More then you might expect this to be a gangsta record. Its nowhere near that. Labtekwon switches up his flow on just about every track and is usually saying something nice with his lyrics. Darkside of the Moon is a good song with an intriguing beat. He tells some good stories on a few other tracks and is even sort of singing on some of the songs. The beats on this album are mostly just straight up hip hop but some of them are a little more spacey with some cool sounds. Labtekwon is a smart guy and it is shown throughout this album. On overlord he is posing as an ancient king and talking about what life was like for his followers. He is also a sentimental emcee talking about love on more than one track, which seems to be the requirement for todays mainstream emcees. Dont worry though they are not sappy at all. If you have never listened to Labtekwon this is a good introduction since it is a career retrospective of an artist who as released eight albums since 1993.      ',nonspam

It took me a minute to enjoy it but going back and listening again and again I discovered what everyone was raving about: Mos Def is a genius. He constructs rhymes that even if they dont seem like they would sound good, due to his flow it comes off amazing. His lyrics are always on point, even when hes making a club track with Busta Rhymes (Do It Know). His voice works well weather he is singing, talking, or rapping. The combination of these styles works well. He recruits some key beat makers for this album including a revitalized Q-Tip, the always on point DJ Premier, and underground heat maker 88 keys. If you are a person who thinks that hip hop is more than shaking your ass then check this album, and if you think that thats all hip hop is check this album out, you might learn a thing or two.

I do not really know how to describe his style. His beats are in the vain of the anticon collective (raw, obscure samples, and other odd sounds not generally associated with hip hop). This Hawaiian born emcee is impressive to say the least. His flow matches the beats well and is generally fast paced. Although he spits his rhymes fast it is still fairly easy to hear what he says. Unlike other Seattle rappers he is not dark and depressed (Onry Ozzborn), he is not raw and gritty (Boom Bap Project), he is his own style that is a great change of pace from the norm in a boring hip hop scene.

He mixes the samples up and always comes with that hot beat. Track 13 is amazing, very mellow but at the same time it gets you hyped up. All these songs are hot. Track 8 with CL Smooth is sick. It shows that pete rock and CL should come back and hit us with that heat, it would be certifiable classic 4 sure. Back to this album, pete does some sick outros and intros to tracks that are really cool, just a short like 10-15 seconds of a tight jazz sample with a hot bassline. This album is a great album for any aspiring rappers. I personally used two of the beats for my first album, but know i got the MPC and makin my own beats. Bottem line Pete Rock is hot and delivers an instrumental album that flows smoothly. Play Dis At Night is one of the smoothest beats i have ever heard with a crazy jazz sample. Petes Jazz is just that some hot jazz that Pete took to a whole other level. The UN are hot but the best track with a rapper on here is "Nothin Lesser" with Freddie Foxx. The Bonus track with the UN #15 is crazy. The Keys that he has in their are sick. So yes indeed this album is hot and i must say you gots to cop it AS SOON AS POSSIBLE its hot as hell      ',nonspam
' A1020L7BWW9RAX	B0002WZSF8	November 22, 2004	0	3	4.0	Interesting? But Good!	 One of the original Beastie Boys doing an alternative rock album? Well Ad Rock did make a country album. At first I did not know what to say about this album, but as I listened so more I found it to be a very good EP. He is experimenting with all kinds of sounds and he did it all himself with a little help from a couple of people. This is what makes this album attractive to me. I love it when an artist does a project all by himself/herself in their own private studio. It seems like the ultimate form of artistic freedom. Mark actually does not have that bad of a voice and the instrumentals backing him are put together well. Dont expect any rapping or DJing on this album but if you like some mellow alternative/indie rock you should dig this, hell I am a hip hop head and Im feeling it.      ',nonspam

I do not think so and with the combination of Lateef the Truth Speaker & Chief Excel from Blackalicious its hard to think that their streak is gonna end. Excels production on this EP is tight as usual and his use of live instrumentation is very nice. He is just getting better and better as time goes by it seems, I am looking forward to the next album with Gift. Speaking of Gift he makes an appearance here on Best of Me and Beautiful You, both of which are nice. Lateef holds the album down perfectly fine though. He addresses the state of the world on If, and just tears apart the rest of these beats with his flow matching the breaks perfectly. Lateef may not be Gift of Gab but he is just as skilled. Where Gift goes for the fast paced flow, Lateef is slower but still just as on point so dont worry about wishing this was just another Blackalicious album, Lateef fits in just fine. While Excel continues to perfect the art of mixing samples, scratches, and live instrumentation together, we get a good album that could have been a little longer but is still better than most of the releases out their.

A lot of times with comps you get a CD full of left over tracks that should never had been released. Not here. Mike Nardone has a radio show in LA called "We Came From Beyond" hence the title. He called in some personal favors and put together this CD. He has been responsible for breaking a lot of these acts on this disc. The production is solid throughout and if you look at the artists you know that lyrically it is gon be tight. The opening track with Esoteric, Celph Titled & Apathy is a good representation of what the Demigodz crew is all about. The J-Zone track is also tight. On the week side of the disc you have the highly disappointing Vast Aire cut "Why is the sky blue?" which is really bad and The Afro Joint (??) track is ok. Overall this comp rates higher than most. It is not terrible not classic just good solid hip-hop all the way through.      ',nonspam

This was the SOBs debut album and it has a very mellow feel to it. Not all the tracks are down tempo, but even when they are they still have a good vibe. These guys style is not reminiscent of LA by any means. No g-funk, gangsta talk, or pimpin here. Instead they are spittin rhymes that will light up the club as well as your brain. Listening to this album is a refreshing mixture of straight up rhyme skills and beats that will suit you wether you like clubin or not. Both these guys have a nice flow and are constructing some sick rhymes. Vin Skully handles most of the production for this album, which is nice. We do not see one producer for whole albums any more...it needs to happen more often. By having one producer it allows the album to flow together very well and not feel like it is cut and pasted together. And once again I will say it: These guys flow perfect to these beats crafting some tight lyrics. Check it out.      ',nonspam

He has produced beats for everyone from Talib and Mos to Snoop and the Eastsidaz. His beats are perfect for Talib but on this album they fit everyone well. He even tries his hand at some R&B with a track from Jonell "Round & Round" which is one of the better songs on this album. Hi-Tek delivers a mixture of his typical raw organic production and some more commercial styled beats. The first song, featuring Common, is a very dope cut as are the Cormega, Talib, and Mos tracks. This album is a good album, better than a lot of the crap out there but it really feels like a compilation more than one artists album. The beats are hot and most of the rappers are on point. It is also nice to see the boot camp click comin back, Tek brings buckshot back for "Illest It Gets". This is a good album but I think Tek should have saved these beats and made another Reflection Eternal album instead.      ',nonspam

This album is the closest we have got to another new Lootpack album since. Madlib and his little brother Oh No handle the production and this album is definitely proof that Oh No can step out of his brothers shadow and shine on his own. Anyway this is a Wildchild album so does he hold it down? Yes. His flow is perfect for these style of beats and he spits some hot lines. His flow is all his own. It has the feel of the laid back Cali vibe but at the same time you could play these tracks at a party without killing the energy. He holds the album down even with guests such as Aceyalone and LMNO. Romes brings the cuts into the album to give it that original feel (more artists need to incorporate the DJ). There are a number of guests but they never outshine Wildchild. Overall this album is another solid release from stones throw with the lyrics and the beats being sick throughout. It is Wildchilds album but Madlibs beats are definitely reason enough to pick it up.      ',nonspam

Five years to the day of his previous classic "Black On Both Sides" being released he dropped his sophomore LP "The New Danger." I cant tell you how hyped I was when I saw that I got to here this album, and for me it did not disappoint. There are a couple of low points but overall it is a very good album. Starts out with his rock band Black Jack Johnson just jamming and Mos is rapping with some singing interspersed, and then he goes blues for a track. That song is good but seems out of place between more hip-hop styled tracks. He jacks "The Takeover" beat for "The Rape Over" not bad for a short track. What follows is a mixture of hip-hop, rock, and blues. Mos sings a little but still raps for most of the album. This is a impressive record. If you have followed Mos carrer over the last five years you know he is not the same person he was when he made and released BOBS but its ok. Unlike Talib he did not go commercial and it seems to be working just fine for him cause it is selling steady. Cop this.      ',nonspam
' A1020L7BWW9RAX	B0002XL22U	October 31, 2004	1	1	4.0	Still amazing with the Lyrics but where are the beats?	 Talib Talib Talib...what can I say about the man? Amazing lyricist, involved in at least one & possibly two classics. He is top five in the game right now. So he goes and makes an album with commercial beats. Hi-Tek sounds like a sell out except on the title track, the rest of the beat makers are mostly club banging type beats. Supa Dave West does deliver a couple solid beats and surprisingly just blaze beat for Never Been In Love is tight. So what is it that makes this album just aight? I dont know. I think it is because anyone who has been onto Talib since the days of Fortified Live or 1-9-9-9 know what Talib can sound like over more organic beats. This is by no means a bad album but it just could have been better. I spent most of this review talking about the beats because lyrically Talib is still amazing: "If lyrics sold than truth be told/Id probably be just as rich as Jay-Z/Truthfully I want to rhyme like Common Sense/Next best thing I do a record with Common Sense." If you want an album full of quotable check this if you are looking for an album full of club banging beats check this if you want an album with vintage Talib over some raw organic beats then go back to blackstar.

They have their problems like any family but when they all hooked up in California for a concert with all nine original members it was on. This album is a good mix of everything the clan has done solo and group wise, the only problem is that when it comes to group tracks they only do one or two verses of them instead of performing the whole song. This is disappointing to anyone who knows classic lines from all the members on different tracks.

Where Madlibs beats sound really old and scratchy, Oh Nos beats dont have that old "blunted" feeling. He can rhyme as well. He opens it with a great song Right Now, which also contains some nice cuts on the 1s & 2s. The guests are nice but they dont outshine Oh No. On The Ride we get to here Med and he sounds as good as ever, a good set up for his solo album soon to come. Even though I said that Oh No does do production his brother laced him with some tight beats as well that are a little atypical for Madlib but still sick. For a debut this is a very solid album, typical west coast Stones Throw hip-hop at its best. Look for Oh No to join his brother in the ranks of classic artists in the future.      ',nonspam

A vast array of west coast producers create the musical backdrop for these guys to spit their lyrics. They are solid all the way through. "Nine Eleven" is one of the best songs about 9/11 with lines like "The only enemy is evil/Not other countries, races, colors, or creeds" they are socially conscious and still bangin.

Of course we all now Snoop is not new, and as the title says he has paid the cost to be the bo$$. The first two songs are both intros that kind of give doggystyle records a mob feel. Stoplight is the first real song and it is one of the best. The lead single with the tunes is tight also. There are a fare amount of guests on this album including Jay-Z, Redman, & Ludacris. This could probably be snoops best since Doggystyle! Premo gives the best beat on the CD with "The One & Only" wich snoop is. Speaking of beats where the hell is DRE???

Some of these reviews may give the idea that Manliness is about squashing beer cans on your head at monster truck rallies. But Mansfield is a deep thinker and this is a thoroughgoing analysis of a human characteristic that isnt going anywhere but isnt being examined or even acknowledged either.  While some schools of feminism seem almost to wish men off the planet rather than examine gender differences in any kind of even handed way Mansfield is quite specific that feminism is not the reason manliness has become the virtue that dare not speak its name.  It is rather "the entire enterprise of modernity." [p. 230]  Manliness is a deeply philosophical examination of a characteristic of humanity drawing on a pantheon of thinkers from a broad spectrum of thought.  That the term manliness seems gratuitously to award a virtue to approximately half of the human race is a semantic stumbling block that many will be unable to overcome.

Christie gives a very...accessible account of what its like to work for the President.  Unfortunately, Christies experiences (as he presents them anyway) come across as though he had about as much impact on meaningful policy as a real fly on the wall.  Certain passages made me cringe as the author described being nearly paralyzed with awe every time he met high profile people for the first time.    I surely hope this was an editing error that slipped through but on page 233 Christie describes Karl Rove as being "thought by many to be the most powerful man in the White House other than the VP".  If that was supposed to be a dig at Bush its pretty unbecoming considering the way Christie fawns over W through the rest of the book.  I STRONGLY suspect a junior proof-reader at publisher Nelson Current let her political views enter into her work and introduced the error as a prank.  Pretty funny.  I wouldnt recommend this for those learning about politics, government and the executive branch either.  It is too lean on how various departments and individuals work together to implement policy.  Also lacking is any insight on how one gets to such a position.        ',nonspam

Before that, it was only the wealthy or the very promising to whom this precious opportunity was given.  As with most things, making it available to everyone changes it to say the very, very least.  The university system of modern times is a business.  Nearly everyone ships their children, however thick they might be, off to get a first-class university education. These masters of SAT prep sessions and little else arent going to line up at the Math, Science and Engineering departments so the Social Science departments are booming.  Tuition funds pour in, along with alumni donations, state and federal grants and, in spite of Title IXs best efforts to the contrary, football and basketball revenues.  A university professorship in the Social Sciences is one of the sweetest gigs there is, for the academic who knows how to milk it.  The university student enrolling in classes must rely on the universitys materials in selecting courses, areas of study and the professors, assistant professors and teaching assistants who will provide instruction.  Efforts to assemble a guide to faculty created BY and for students (and their parents) are met with academias severest measures.  Such faculty directories can not be produced, distributed or even possessed on any campus facilities (including electronic resources.)  Horowitzs directory of the 101 looniest profs should be considered the first of many installments; a note of encouragement to student groups everywhere to storm the barricades and shine the harsh light of day on what their prospective teachers are all about.  Students: CREATE AND PUBLISH A DIRECTORY OF YOUR SCHOOLS FACULTY TODAY!    Horowitz states in his introduction "This book is not intended as a text about left-wing bias in the university and does not propose that this bias is necessarily a problem. [But, the] professorial task is to teach students how to think, not to tell them what to think."  Somehow, those who managed to read the entire book while standing in the aisle at the local bookseller also managed to miss that bit (they may have been put off by the scary roman numerals.)  Parents: Before you send your kids off to college next fall, write a letter to the president of their prospective universities and ask if you can publish a faculty and course directory based on student and parent observations.  Be sure to leave yourself time to select a different school when you hear the reaction.      ',nonspam

Harfords efforts to liven up what he has to say fall a bit flat.  What I found more disappointing was Harfords approval for redistributive policies.

If you characterize the current state of gender relations in the Western World as a gender war then "Self-Made Man" must be treated as the contents of a captured spys briefcase.  If you are not that paranoid, its still pretty good.  A shortcoming is that she limits her adventures in ways that show more about class distinctions than gender.  Vincents choices throughout the book show she is disdainful of the workaday world and the things ordinary people do to have fun and earn a living.  Some of her experiments could have been done without the masquerade but they would have been called "slumming."  She concludes, and I agree with her, that gender is a different phenomenon from sex.  But she also claims that people are taught their gender in early childhood and this I dont agree with.  (She seems to have missed the research that shows little girls playing dolls with "daddy and mommy" toy trucks and little boys using dolls as tools and jet planes.)  She also shows convincingly that people continue to accept original gender identification even if the outward cues are taken away.  I suspect some of Vincents test subjects saw through her gender disguise immediately and simply treated her as a man because the circumstances made it irrelevant.  It is worth considering what impact this work will have among feminists.  It seems reasonable to expect a string of copycats so be on the lookout for the fellow who asks for extra napkins with the order of wings and forgets to look at the waitresss bottom.  I think we can also expect another round of women telling us its okay to cry when we all know its not.  "Self-Made Man" is a fun read and carries a few tidbits of useful wisdom.  Vincent states right up front that this is not a scientific experiment so cut her some slack if she cuts a few corners.  She seems like a basically decent person who did something interesting that took real cajones.        ',nonspam

Now, all you right-thinking conservatives take note.  This book is well thought of by the NYT but dont let that put you off.  It is a well presented examination of how economics can be used to explore social issues.  Freakonomics rightly shows that economics is the study of human decisions (and not, as liberals claim, the study of how to balance ones checkbook.)  The authors address social questions in ways that liberals will find blasphemous.  Liberals are notorious for using dubious "facts" to advocate policies which redirect resources away from those whove shown they can use them to maximum public advantage and toward those whove shown they will squander them.  Freakonomics exposes their slight of hand.  You may not agree with every implication of Freakonomics but you will respect the rigorous analysis with which the authors attack their subjects.

Some reviews make the author sound like a crass and vulgar man but I think he is just frank and forthright.  He jokes regularly about being from the planet AD (arrested development) but pre-PC is a more accurate diagnosis.  Feminists might be offended that he does not genuflect at the altar of Sally Ride but rather holds Judy Resnik in higher regard.      ',nonspam

Sinatra was a competent actor and probably could have paid the bills this way even if he hadnt been a remarkably talented singer.  Its not everybody who can pull off a menacing tough-guy when he weighs 118 soaking wet.  This film presents itself in stark tones both visually and thematically.  Patriotism, courage, honor, sacrifice.  The words necessary to make that into a sentence would only sully the higher meaning; and thats the feeling you get as you watch this film.  It is sparse, but self-assured.  Think of it as the lost episode of "The Andy Griffith Show."      ',nonspam
' A10250WFWWKGWV	1595230092	January 24, 2006	18	23	5.0	Feminists dont know much about women.	 I can see why some are trying so hard to discredit this book and discourage any from reading it; it gives feminists a lot to answer for.  Consider the following passage regarding followers of feminist ideology:  "Their sensitivities were being sharpened to such an edge that some were turned into relentless grievance collectors or rendered too suspicious to function in the workaday world outside of Womens Studies and were left with few possible roles in life beyond that of angry feminists."  (p.86 )  This is the perfect illustration of she who posts a review she didnt write for a book she didnt read.  Maybe what we are seeing is a kind of coming of age for women.  Theyve been taken care of by men for so many generations and now they are expected to make their own way in the world.   Just as teenagers often go to great lengths to establish their independence at a certain age; some women feel the need to lash out at what they see as the vestiges of male domination.  What they wind up doing, though, is directing most of their venom at the men who deserve it least but are most willing to put up with it.  What women should be doing is examining the philosophical implications of choosing their own destinies.  One can not have ones cake and eat it too.  That is not a limitation placed on women by men; it is a simple fact of the universe we live in.  Generations of kept women have demanded that their men work harder and earn more so that proverbial cake could be both eaten and had.  Their men responded by working themselves to death.  Todays feminists are demanding more government to give them the things they think they deserve.  The world cannot survive more experiments in Socialism.  Ladies, its time to wrap up the adolescent thing and start acting like the adults you claim to be.      ',nonspam

I confess that I enjoy liberal baiting immensely.  I dont think the current administration is substantially different from any that we have had in the past 50 years.  To see people wailing in the streets as though Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot and Mobuto had marched into Washington arm in arm is comical when voter turnouts and other forms of legitimate political participation are so low.  I was hoping to hear stories of Liberals demonstrating their profound misconceptions of how the grown-up world works.  But these are stories of hatred and paranoia; scary stories.  Even if you ignore the celebrity inanities; even if you ignore the yammering of average jane and joe liberal citizen you are still faced with university professors, radio commentators and elected officials, people with an acknowledged responsibility to act in the public interest, who are seething with hatred for...everything apparently.

I hope that is the case so any who put work into "The Interpreter" can say they at least accomplished something.  A really good spy thriller will maintain a nagging sense in the back of your mind that there is something amiss but keeps the action coming so you wont have an idle moment to ponder it.  At the very end, the final piece of the puzzle will drop into place just in time to roll credits.  In this movie, that nagging detail is so glaringly obvious that a non-stop chase scene couldnt mask it and there are no chase scenes in this movie worthy of the name.  Staggering coincidences are required every few minutes to keep the plot moving.  When the details of the nefarious conspiracy are revealed, the viewer is left thinking "really, thats it?

' A10250WFWWKGWV	0393060985	October 17, 2005	3	10	3.0	If it be a sin to covet honor, shes got nothing to worry about	 This is not a great book, but it is an interesting book.  If you are looking for a well written and lucid account of a womans unique experiences in combat, keep looking  (Actually, try She Went to War: The Rhonda Cornum Story.)  If you are looking for some insight into how womens changing roles in society are manifesting themselves, hold your nose and give this a read.  The very first hurdle you will have to overcome in getting through this book is the fractured "mall-chick" prose.  Williams claims to be pretty sharp academically and perhaps she is but her grammar is horrific.  The next hurdle is the style.  This might be a gender thing but I find the "heres what happened, heres what I said and heres how I felt about it" structure of storytelling to be a root-canal sans novocaine.  Taken together, I think those two defects make an excellent starting point in discussing why this book is worth a tree or two.  I have no problem believing Williams is a well-educated and intelligent person.  She has chosen to write in this dumbed-down voice not to be "accessible" but to provide plausible denial lest she be held responsible for what she has to say.  Williams segues maddeningly between an intelligent young woman commenting on her place in world events and a vapid party-girl looking for her next thrill.  And there is one of the big differences between men and women.  Men are taught early on to decide who they are going to be: to thine own self be true.  Women take pride in being able to "chameleon" their way through life and share tips with each other to refine their techniques.  I was in the service and I continue to be fascinated with the culture of the military.  Williams account testifies that most aspects of military life havent changed much since my day.  But the  account of Williams making her (female) sergeant cry and getting chewed out by her (also female) lieutenant for not being more sensitive to the sergeants feelings gives the exact kind of insight to the modern army I was looking for.  For most of human history, the military was the bastion of "maleness."  Strength, stoicism and principle were the walls meant to defend civilization in times of danger. There is a reason that two formations of young armed men marching toward each other across an open field and slaughtering each other inspires epic poetry while modern accounts of military activity often include the word "surreal."  Society is meant to protect women and children at the expense of mens lives.  It will not be a simple thing for us as a people to learn entirely new roles for ourselves.  Love My Rifle More Than You is a worthwhile source for examining this evolution.      ',nonspam

It is a lengthy rationalization of how liberals reconcile their stated beliefs with their actual day-to-day choices.  George Lakoff rates things like aesthetic appreciation and capacity to experience pleasure near the top of the list of important civic attributes.    His "insights" about conservative thinking are profoundly misinformed.  He really should talk to a conservative once in a while though I can see how awkward that would be for both parties.  The passage below, found on p. 32 deserves to be quoted in full:  "It is important that the public become aware that we think by using conceptual systems that are not immediately accessible to consciousness and that conceptual metaphor is part of our normal thought processes."  You see not only do we think with systems inaccessible to our consciousness (?!), but also it is important that the public become aware of this.   You will not find a better illustration of how liberals and conservatives differ in the ways they think about public matters.  A liberal has on his list of things to do making the public aware that we think by using inaccessible sytems.  Try dropping the above quote into ordinary conversation (off-campus please)sometime.

Continuing in the role he began in "Home Grown: he has anointed himself "The Old Scout" in a weekly newspaper column taking advantage of the boosterism of the local newspaper.  They give him a soapbox not for his keen insight into world affairs but because he is a nationally known, though narrowly enjoyed, entertainer.  When he does come to Minnesota, he lives on St. Pauls Summit Avenue, the tiny enclave of Minnesotas "old money" and a 5 minute ride by limo to the airport.  Keillors fantasies of a simpler time when people helped each other are sometimes heartwarming.  But people should realize that while Midwesterners are very nice to each other for the most part, it does not follow that we all see tax and spend liberalism as the answer to the worlds problems.  It is shameful how Keillor dances between the roles of entertainer and political commentator.  It is infuriating how Keillor seeks to portray rural Midwesterners as natural advocates of his brand of socialism when, in reality, they are staunch Red-staters held hostage to Blue Metro areas.

Indeed, some scholars suggest that the American infatuation with the story of the Mayflower colony comes not from its role in the birth of the nation, but rather as a consequence of the large proportion of New England academics who founded the Smithsonian institution.  Whatever the reason, the story of the creation of Englands first North American colony is altogether more darker than the foundation its more famous Massachusetts cousin.  Milton captures this complex story very clearly, managing to give robust characerizations of the many individuals who come and go throughout the story.  The two main figures, Sir Walter Ralegh and Queen Elizabeth, are clearly conceived despite the fact that Milton avoids the temptation to speculate about matters not covered in the historical record.  Given this admirable restraint, Miltons story more than succeeds on its own terms.  The historical account is gripping -- and the mysteries contained therein are pursued clearly and rationally.  The writing, though remarkably detailed, never gets bogged down in them.  Milton manages to give a panorama of the times without ever seeming explicitly engaged in academic history.  It is a painless way to learn but still remarkably satisfying.  If I have any complaints, they come down to some of his conclusions.  He claims, for example, that the ultimate success of Jamestown was a result of the final acceptance of Raleghs stricture that peace with the natives is essential.  I agree that while this is very important, there appears to be no question that the real reason for the success was not merely that peace was achieved (through a marriage) but rather that the growth of the tobacco industry in the new world helped sustain the infusion of capital that made the colony possible.  Love didnt create America, money did.      ',nonspam

Clare Tomalins new biography has received lots of attention -- while a new weblog of Pepys diary has been highly publicized (and is well worth checking out in its own right).  I came to Cootes book for the meanest of reasons -- it was cheaper, but I have no regrets.  This is a very readable, sometimes rollicking, turn through the details of Pepys life.  Dont expect careful analysis of the literary aspects of the diary nor rich historical background.  (This is a popular history in both good and bad senses of the term.) Pepys is front and center on every page of this book and were it not for the extraordinary nature of his life it might have grown tiresome.  We are with him in broad strokes and minor flourishes -- from silly infatuations to grand schemes of Royal skullduggery we see remarkable detail of both the man and the time.  It is fascinating stuff and Coote doesnt get in the way.  The details move quickly and coherently and when the diary itself ends the reader hardly notices.  Compiling a detailed account of Pepys subsequent trials and tribulations from letters and parliamentary reports, our vision of the man remains steady.  Perhaps the greatest value of a biography of this sort is that it moves you towards the diary itself.  This is no small achievement for Coote and says something about Pepys himself.      ',nonspam

The title, for one, is entirely misleading.  One would suppose that such a book would include an account of the plague and its effects throughout Europe in the fourteenth century.  Instead, Cantor focuses almost entirely on England - and even then less as a document about the plague but rather a history of fourteenth century Britain.  This is fascinating stuff, and thus not without merit, but not exactly what I had expected or hoped for.  There are sections on philosophical movements, the English occupation of the western third of France, and, near the end, a long and rather digressive discussion of Chaucer (who, as Cantor himself points out, never addresses the plague at all).   Cantors emphasis on England can be confusing - he notes for example that Englands hold on parts of France might have been weakened by the loss of manpower in the plague, but doesnt address the question of whether the relative strength of French and English armies would not have changed.  After all, there was a plague in France too.    These sorts of quandaries might have been small potatoes if not for the fact that the book is so short. Indeed, it provides an unintended primer on how to pad a book for market.  The double spacing is unusual in a trade paperback as well as the inclusion of a very broad and wide-ranging bibliography of secondary sources.  More perplexing, however, is Cantors tendency to repeat himself.  One gets the impression in this effort that Cantor has cobbled together a collection of talks or older papers under a single heading without adjusting then in light of the material in the others.   Indeed, the last section, where Cantor addresses his historical precedents within medievalism sounds a lot like his previous book Inventing the Middle Ages.  Moreover, real and embarrassing errors abound.  Cantor introduces the work of Donald Johansen, the famous anthropologist and discoverer of Lucy, as Grant Johansen while simultaneously proposing that Lucy was black.  An odd thing, given that Lucy was an entirely distinct species from humans (indeed, genus as well).  I am not sure if it is fair to fault a medievalist for bad anthropology, but there should be a fact checker somewhere in this process.    Thus, it is short, off-topic, sloppy and repetitive.  But it would be unfair to call it dull.  Cantor revels in being frank about difficult and sensitive issues, and enjoys (perhaps too much) using modern comparisons to make his points.  This was an interesting time, and despite its many faults, this is an interesting book.      ',nonspam
' A102KJ9K5Q20PA	0385334117	December 14, 2002	3	4	3.0	Whimsical cabinet of curiosities	 Allin describes a custom of the Victorian age in which the landed gentry would collect and display a broad spectrum of natural curiosities.  You would find skins of various creatures, bones, unusual stones, and so on brought together not because of any intrinsic affinity amongst the items, but rather as a display of erudition and education.  Seen in the same way, one could regard both Allins subject, Zarafa -- the first giraffe on the European continent since Roman times -- and the book itself as examples of the same kind of intellectual curiosity.  Much of what Allin describes is connected by the thinnest of threads.  His history of the French occupation of Egypt, of the Mamelukes and Napoleonic sea battles have all but the slimmest contextual connection with the life of the giraffe first corralled in Ethiopia and transferred to Paris.  This would be a greater complaint if the stories were less compelling, but on some level the book doesnt quite rise to the sum of its parts.  Ultimately, this is the story of a sensation -- of the exotic species that briefly bewitched the French in the mid-nineteenth century -- but one in which the object of this sensation is never quite more than an ethereal object of gossip and speculation.  At the center of the story the giraffe is strangely (though perhaps not surprisingly) absent.  As if its magic is exhausted by its docility.  This disappointment is met by the interest I found in other aspects of the many storylines, but none of this is terribly compelling, even if it is well told.      ',nonspam

Coming as it does with only a quick install guide (which is not compatible with WinNt or 2000) and difficult to follow on-line support, figuring out the details is something that requires a little experience with wireless routers or a well placed friend with networking experience.  If you have that experience then you should have no problem putting the unit together, but without it you could spend many hours adjusting parameters that have no effect on the performance of the machine.   While there is no printed manual, a disk version can help you run through some of the issues you might have with this machine, but even then the support is poorly written and relies too heavily on jargon and terminology that might be unfamiliar to new users of this technology.  Even now, with the system up and running, I remain unsure as to how to configure a number of the customizable features that make this unit so powerful.   And it is powerful.  The printing connection is extremely useful and the wireless signal is strong.  I havent had any problems beyond installation (and again with adequate documentation I dont think I would have had these problems).   Finally, while the unit does have a kind of polished high tech look.  Its overall veneer is kind of plasticky and cheap.  The two rubber antennas connect loosely and easily fall over.  It was also packed in such a way that the power adapter prongs sat on top of the device so that they left superficial scratches on the paint.  This does not impair the functionality of the router, but cosmetically it is disappointing -- especially when you pull the router out of the box.   I have had better experiences with netgear routers and would recommend them over this item.  I find they are more sturdily constructed and come with far superior documentation and support.  I chose this unit for home use because of the printer connection and its price.  I would probably choose differently if I had to again.      ',nonspam

Hessler, in Rivertown, is quite up front about seeking out his Peace Corps position as an occasion and subject matter for this book.  It doesnt matter.  The experience is so fully immersive and complete that Hessler is forced to venture far beyond any writerly conventions to take a very fresh and engaging look at a place completely at odds with his own personal experience.  The results are often fascinating.  Hesslers never quite escapes the culture shock (both for him and his Chinese neighbours) that his teaching position in Fuling provides.  He is stared at, mocked, and humiliated, but also adopted, pampered and adored.  A book about his special status as an outsider in China would have been very interesting in its own right, but Hessler struggles to find ways to fully connect with the people of his town.  That he is only partially successful is part of the story, and his attempts to make this connection are captivating if sometimes heartbreaking.  From his early struggles with doctrinaire Chinese instructors to coping with traffic, noise and alienation, he paints a very honest picture of both himself and his situation.  Insofar as he makes the connections he is looking for, the book paints a remarkable picture of Chinese life in a town that will soon be largely submerged by the rising waters of the Three Gorges Dam.  The immediacy of the place, and his willingness to share his sometimes ungainly appreciation of his role there, make this both an unusual and dramatic discussion of modern Chinese life that is at once personal and universal.

We might expect his next to be about the Tropic of Cancer or salt marshes.  Whatever it is, I suspect it will be a worthy and fascinating concoction.   While he writes this book from the perspective of what he calls a "islomane", one who fascinated with islands, it makes compelling reading for someone who lacks this particular fascination.  As a prairie boy I am more fascinated by mountains than islands, but because Clarke weaves so much collateral information into his text, you will never be anything less than fully engaged.  He visits all kinds of islands from tourist meccas to summer cottages to northern coal mines.  These journeys seem terribly difficult, but Clarke never lets the encumbrances of modern travel get in the way of his examination of both the fascination he has with islands in general and the particulars of what makes any given island worth visiting.  He comes to many surprisingly interesting generalizations about the nature of islands and islanders (that for example changes on islands are usually more permanent than elsewhere).  As a traveler he reminds me of Paul Theroux, and certainly his writing is on that level, though without the annoying flashes of ego that often make Theroux painful.  It is interesting to compare Clarkes island jaunts with Therouxs Happy Isle of Oceania.  Both authors distinctly render the sense of desperation that emerges from these isolated places, but Clarke appears to have a greater sense of the humanity of the people who inhabit them.  Perhaps it takes an islomane to truly empathize with those likewise afflicted. Much as I enjoyed this book, I would also recommend Clarkes book on his travels around the equator.  I found these places more interesting, and the quality of the writing is just as high.      ',nonspam
' A102KJ9K5Q20PA	0802713734	June 30, 2002	6	7	4.0	A Salty Tale	 In this book, Kurlansky attempts to do for salt what he did for cod in his book about the fish the changed the world.  Salt seems a broader topic, though one whose historical impact is less unified.  This gives the book a rather disjointed aspect, as though we need jump through each cultures perspective and history in making, acquiring and using salt.  While various themes do emerge, Kurlansky seems more taken with the project of finding interesting and flavourful anecdotes to fill the pages and hold the readers interest.  He is mostly successful, from the story of prehistorical miners perfectly preserved in salt to the role that salt played in the development of American history.  There are very few bases that he does not appear to touch, but nevertheless the story is never quite so cohesive as to justify this especially meandering approach.  Despite this, I have been annoying my friends and relatives for weeks with the sorts of salty nuggets that Kurlansky often uncovers.  There are, it seems, a million and one things you can do with brine.  Unfortunately, Kurlansky never really develops a sense of what is magical and special about salt - its transformative properties.  Why does it preserve so well?  Why does it change dull food into the gourmet?  And why this particular fascination with salt through human history?   Kurlansky often seems like an accountant searching for something valuable along the salt trail.  He often succeeds and these stories can be quite fascinating, but unlike his history of cod, the story never comes together.  The history of salt is really just the history of a chemical and though in many respects it is fascinating in its own right, its own right is really not as expansive or inclusive as Kurlansky would have us believe.     These complaints are not, however, quite so deep as they sound.   The book is consistently interesting and well-written throughout.  Kurlansky has mastered clear and articulate non-fiction writing.  He never stays too long on a subject, and finds interest in each of his digression.  I would recommend his book on cod and his excellent, if uneven, collection of short stories before tackling this one, but it is, in the end, certainly worth getting to.      ',nonspam

Indeed, contrary to what some reviewers say, I think this book would be welcomed by historians.  It neither glamorizes nor sensationalizes the privations and accomplishments of the time, but rather sets about putting medieval life (especially in England) into a larger communal context.  There is no overemphasis on kingship and battles, but rather an attempt to portray the gritty and sometimes harrowing details of daily life.  This is a "what it was like" approach to history that remains conservative in its goals and straightforward about its sources.  In following the book of days around the calendar year, we get insights into the daily life of peasants and aristrocracy alike -- with a special emphasis on how the moving calendar had an impact on the lives of the people living on the land.  This is a special and modest insight, and I think an interesting one.  The book is, for all that, quite short and very readable.  Now that the millenium is passed, this book remains a worthy and valuable contribution for those who want a taste of the Earth over a thousand years ago.      ',nonspam

Was he trying to write a scholarly history of the Taiping rebellion or was he writing a popular one?  The level of detail in much of the book suggests the former -- using long quotes and a passion for detail that often renders the text dense and unwieldy, Spence manages to make much of this story impregnable.  This would be fitting, and all too common, for an academic history, but clearly this is not his intent.  Leaving out such things as the ultimate influence of the Taiping rebellion on Chinese life or the Qing perspective on the rebellion makes the story rather less than complete.  But if this is a popular history, then why the long interludes about the exact details of Western missionary movements around Southwest China prior to Hong Xiuquans conversion?  I found this segment excruciating and entirely unnecessary.  Perhaps there is more justification for his extended discussion of Taiping theology, but these seem unduly detailed for a popular history.   The saving grace in all this is the story.  The events of the Taiping rebellion are so unlikely and remarkable that even with these textual issues, the book is difficult to put down.  The fantastic, anomolous story of Hongs revolution is nail-biting stuff and certain worth trudging through the muddy prose through which it is conveyed.  I am not sure I would pick up another book by Jonathan Spence, but I am glad I made it through this one.      ',nonspam
' A102KJ9K5Q20PA	0936184531	October 17, 2001	46	48	4.0	The Science of Good Cooking	 The Best Recipe books have an interesting perspective on cooking and cookbooks.  Resolutely scientific, recipes are developed in their test kitchens according to methodical experimentation -- you get not only the best recipe, but insight into the variations of the recipe that failed.  This makes for interesting reading, and highlights many practical errors and pitfalls that spoil a good clam chowder or weaken a chicken paprikash.  For example, they put to test the idea that beef bourguignon is only as good as the wine used in the cooking.  (The answer, sadly, is yes -- good wine makes better beef bourguignon.)  In many places, this puts them at odds with staunch traditionalists, advocating, for example, the use of canned stock in certain dishes (which is tantamount for many cooks to a heresy).  The systematic approach might then threaten the art of cooking, while advocating a new scientific approach, but the results in my experience (not only this book but also from cooking illustrated from which the recipes are drawn) tend to be quite good -- and like any good scientific result, reliable.   It is worth noting that because of this detailed approach to classic dishes as problems that must be solved, there are relatively few recipes in the book relative to its length.  I enjoy the reports, though they might put off someone looking for straightforward recipes.      ',nonspam

As a truly indigenous cuisine, it represents an approach to cooking almost totally unfamiliar both to home cooks and classically trained chefs.  This is why Bayless book is such a valuable contribution for those interested in getting away from American interpretations of Mexican food.  While he emphasizes traditional recipes, Bayless is not doctrinaire.  He also adds contemporary interpretations of classic dishes which at once preserve the authentic quality of the originals, while exploring and incorporating new ingredients.  Moreover, he offers more than simple recipes, but also a guide to understanding what it is about traditional Mexican cooking that leads to its unique flavours.  This helps inspire substitutions for ingredients not readily available and greater skills in creating notoriously difficult to reproduce Mexican standards like refried beans or ceviche.   If I have any complaints about this book, they come down to the following.  There are relatively few recipes in the book, which is largely a function of the explanations I endorsed earlier.  There are also many recipes in this book which are quite similar to dishes provided in his other cookbooks.  Somebody already familiar with Bayless work might find this somewhat frustrating.   However, as a first book on Mexican cooking, I can think of none better placed to produce a better meal.  This is an expensive book, but one that is nicely adorned and marvelously designed.  I would recommend it to any seriously interested in coming to knwo one of the finest cuisines in the world.      ',spam
' A102KJ9K5Q20PA	006099486X	October 3, 2001	5	5	4.0	Diverting Story	 Winchester writes popular history in both the good and bad senses of the term.  He enjoys the apocryphal and often inserts stories, with suitable disclaimers, that he knows to be false, in places he speculates wildly concerning motives of historical figures and the details of actions no one witnessed, while at the same time retaining a real sense of the excitement and interest of the historical period he is examining.  He does strive to get the details right, even when they cant be known, and works hard to produce a detailed picture of the time in which the action takes place.  Some times it is awkward, as in his altogether too brusque treatment concerning the complex composition of the union army in the civil war (which, ultimately, didnt strike me as terribly relevant anyway), but often it is fascinating.  The details of building the OED are compelling and they give a sense of both the importance of the work Dr. Minor was engaged in and the remarkably difficult nature of that work -- especially for one certifiably mad.   Winchesters treatment of madness is compassionate and though he clearly loves these characters he never romanticizes them, nor downplays the serious obstacles they face, both in terms of the madness itself and the difficulties encountered with respect to social class.  Despite Minors clearly objectionable behaviour, you come away feeling a great sorrow for the man who couldnt make it through the night without being haunted by all manner of tortures.   The writing itself is brisk, though often overwrought.  (Winchester has a tendency to use purple prose when trying to get to our emotions.)  But the book moves steadily along, and most of the diversions if not always necessary are interesting enough on their own.  Despite these complaints, I read the book avidly and had a hard time putting it down.  Thus, reservations about history aside, I would recommend it.   His new book, The Map that Changed the World, roughly does for geology what he does here for lexicography.  It is a reverential treatment, but equally compelling and worth a read.  (I would be inclined to start with this one, however, since his many personal asides in that one are often a tad irritating and kept largely to a minimum here.)      ',nonspam

They are sly and funny and over the course of two or so pages they build to a sardonic conclusion that effectively skewers his chosen target.  At times, in Shopgirl, he seems motivated by similar satirical goals.  He has trouble with Los Angeles and does much to undo the pretense without being didactic or overweening.  But the satire never builds and largely dissipates by the storys conclusion.   The story faces similar obstacles.  The two lead characters, well meaning both, are shy and hesitant (and as such easy to identify with), but we can neither love them or hate them.  Mirabelles mistakes come as much from her own vacuity as the shallowness of the world, and her ultimate rehabilitation goes no deeper than the self-help books that guide her prospective beau.  Rays appetites are no less shallow or easily satisfied, and his preoccupations altogether as banal and self-involved as Mirabelles, if not morally worse. It is not that these are loathsome characters, in fact we can see ourselves too easily in them.  They simple dont draw us in.  Martin is fascinated by the awkward moments in conversations, and yet apparently bored by any other.  His characters fumble for what to say in a world where any response is either a cliche (and hence dull) or truthful (and hence dull and hurtful).   Despite these complaints, there is certainly nothing in this work that suggests that Martin is not a capable and interesting writer.  There are many valuable and interesting observations of modern life in this book -- often bluntly but accurately drawn.  However, a better example, I think, of the kind of book he wants to write might be Nick Hornbys High Fidelity or About a Boy, both of which take on the kinds of relationship issues Martin is concerned with but strike a better balance between the selfishness of the characters and comedic or satirical elements of the book.

Born of humble origins, he managed, despite enormous pluck and know-how, to return to them in his dotage. The great arc of this life is very interesting and Simon Winchester does a marvelous job in putting together the pieces of this story in a way that not only portrays the development of Smiths famous map, but also the historical context in which it was developed. I found much of this background material as rewarding as the narrative itself. However, if both components are strong, sometimes it seems as though Winchester was worried about their cumulative effect. He tends to overhype the map - noting not only in the title that it changed the world, but throughout the book itself. Unfortunately, if it was a new way of looking at the world, Winchester spends little time showing how the map could exert its influence. How does a two dimensional map portray the three dimensional strata of the earth? The problems are not merely technical, for while Smith came to be recognized for his contributions, it is not clear how others built on them and how they have had a lasting influence. These concerns, coupled with a tendency to overpersonalize his attachment to Smiths story, were my only reservations. Winchester is an otherwise clear and enthusiastic writer and the book moves quickly through the details of Smiths life with compassion and understanding. This is certainly a book I would recommend.  Online buyers should also note that the book jacket itself unfolds to become a bright coloured replica of Smiths original map. This is a very nice touch.      ',nonspam
' A102KJ9K5Q20PA	0140143459	September 9, 2001	3	4	4.0	Gamblers anonymous	 In many ways, it is not clear what sort of book Lewis intends to write. At times, it is a memoir, at times simple gossip, and in others a guide to how the street works. It is a testimony to Lewis skills as a journalist that he largely succeeds in each of this tasks, giving clear explanations of both the rise of the mortage market and Milkens revolutionary ways with junk bonds, while managing to capture the surprising undercurrents of life in a Wall Street investment firm. It is, needless to say, not pretty -- and Lewis cynically (though honestly, I think) captures the petty interests and conflicts of interest that dominate the trading floor. I am not sure where to put my money now, but I am certainly keeping it away from those banks! There are, however, some unexpected heroes in the book. Lew Raineris hard charging mortage desk, a bastion of old fashioned ideals (which is itself a good and a bad thing), is portrayed in loving and often hilarious detail, despite the lack of first hand experience, while Michael Milkens junk bond antics are singled out for special appreciation. These choices may seem suspect now -- Raineris success didnt outlive the competition and Milken is now widely regarded as a villain, but Lewis perspective has the advantage of capturing the time in which these views were developed. As history, it is fascinating if not always correct. The final pages of the book depict, somewhat artificially, Salomon Brothers as it grapples with a take over bid. The action, while dramatic, seems more like a pretense for a big finish than the climax of the story Lewis is telling. The market went on, and so did Salomon brothers. But Lewis left, and his reasoning is unclear. He was certainly successful, and stood to be more so. His stated reasons seem unsatisfying, and the distance between his experiences during the book and his reluctance to share more intimate details of the forces that compelled his decision ultimately renders the conclusion unsatisfying. This is a small complaint, however, and the book is certainly worth reading. Look for When Genius Failed for an update on some of the characters of Liars Poker. It follows John Meriwethers ultimately unsuccessful attempts to revolutionize options trading and proves a compelling sequel (of sorts) to this book.      ',nonspam

In a way, it is more like two books.  On the one hand, it is the story of his personal endeavour to climb the ranking in competitive scrabble, and on the other it is a journalists attempt to understand both the fascination and phenomenon of competitive scrabble itself.  Thus, we get both breathless accounts of his competitions (and those of the experts he befriends) and tours of scrabble factories, historical sketches of the games development, and so on.  Somewhere in between the personal narrative and discharging his responsibilities as a journalist Fatsis writes something of a handbook on how to become a scrabble player.  These sections are long and often detailed.  He is impressed by anagramming (which is to scrabble what skating is to hockey), and gives detailed account of how collections of letters can be turned in many words you have never heard of.  Scrabble is least fun when your opponent plunks down a word you have never heard of because it seems a bit like cheating.  Did you know that sh is a word? ug? op? hm -- these should help in your next game, but personally I found the detail overwhelming at times, and found myself skimming through the technical sections to get to the bits where he competes.   But it isnt all action.  Along the way, he portrays a great number (perhaps too many) of the characters he meets in the tournaments he plays.  These are a pretty odd collection of people, but Fatsis, to his credit, is never condescending and retains a personal warmth that keeps his story human.  That scrabble great Joel Sherman felt comfortable with the book is a sign that Fatsis didnt violate the trust of his subjects, but the book is hardly a soft touch.  These people often have real problems, and Fatsis neither sugar coats his account nor apologizes for their behaviour.  It is, in this sense, a honest and worthy book. Despite this, getting through the technical sections often feels unrewarding and in retrospect I have somehow found myself thinking that equations like J=8 or K=5 are as immutable as any laws of nature.  Skipping through these sections is worth it, because the story and the obession and quite interesting.  In this respect, Fatsis book reminds me somewhat of Susan Orleans excellent The Orchid Thief, a similar tale of a subculture based on mutual passions.      ',nonspam
' A102KJ9K5Q20PA	0060195185	August 3, 2001	5	7	3.0	Solid, but dull	 The title is perhaps a misnomer: the story is never quite so dramatic as it promises to be.  I was led to this book by an episode of the PBS series Nova about the dispute over the relative heights of K2 and Everest.  It was fascinating and it drew into the debate the story of Lambton and Everests survey.  I was hoping that this book would give me some of the details that the television show lacked the time to include.  The book is solid on the history, but manages to keep its distance from the key characters (while letting interesting side characters and assistants slide from view).   I was disappointed by the end, not really knowing much about the cantankerous Everest, or Lambton, and not full grasping why the British seemed so obsessed about a survey that they hadnt even completed for the British Isles.   The naming of the mountains is something of a footnote, and I believe hardly a definitive account of the politics behind it.  Despite this, Keay is a capable writer, though one, it seems, hardly in the thrall of his topic.  I was hoping to get a simplified, but vivid account of how surveying works, but I found the discussion a bit murky in the beginning, and no clearer by the end.   These complaints are apt to seem minor if you come to the topic with an avid interest in how India was mapped (though, of course, this would make you rather unusual), but I dont think you will develop that interest in reading the book.  Good nonfiction should stimulate the reading of more nonfiction in related areas, but I find myself looking elsewhere now.  Clearly, the great arc was one of the most incredible scientific achievements of its or any other age -- taking over fifty years to complete.  Its a shame that Keays book doesnt really convey both the enormity of the task and the passion that led to its completion.      ',nonspam
' A102KJ9K5Q20PA	0374125139	July 28, 2001	8	9	3.0	Good as far as it goes, which isnt too far at all	 Gourevitchs earlier book was such a fine piece of writing and journalism that I had high expectations for this one when I spotted it at a bookstore a couple of days ago.  It should be noted, especially for those shopping on Amazon, that it is a very slim volume.  That they were able to squeeze nearly 200 pages out of the original manuscript says more about the printers, triple spacing and wide fonts that it does about the authors legwork.  I was able to finish it in slightly less than two hours, which makes it an expensive read for the time it takes up.  It is perhaps no coincidence that the story itself seems better suited to a Readers Digest than a full length book treatment (but then again this is hardly a full length book).  Gourevitch seems motivated to write a sort of hard boiled story about a kid on the wrong side of the law and the dedicated cop who brings him to justice.  He keeps his sentences very short, and his descriptions are limited to characters who look like Bogart and bad guys with ruddy complexions and New York dialects.  Perhaps he was aiming for a sort of genre story, but the format limits him considerably.  The cops story is hagiographic and the murderers tale is told with a sympathy that Gourevitch feels compelled to deny.  The capture is embarassingly easy (and points out rather awkwardly that police incompetence might be more responsible for the murderers time on the lam than his genius) and the subsequent denouement couched in cliches rather than insight. (I cringed at the portrayal of the money grubbing Jewish lawyer who, apparently, performed most of his work in this case for free).   This is not to say that the book is racist, but hackneyed and while the story can hold your interest, it stays disappointingly close the surface.  If you are a fan of the true crime genre, then this might make a quick and interesting read, but certainly Gourevitch is capable of something much deeper and challenging than this.      ',nonspam

It is not a book of macho adventure, though his lack a natural sailing ability does make for some harrowing moments.  His trip between Vancouver Island and Tahiti serves more as reference point for deeper, more personal reflections than a pure narrative, and he manages this without any penchant for flakey expostulations about his personal growth or metaphysical speculations about the nature of travel.  Indeed, along the way he finds himself dissatisfied with the presentation of travel that he finds in other writers, like Chatwin or Theroux, and in taking them to task he exposes much of the myth of travel as a way of finding ones self.  This is heady stuff, but he manages it without preaching or self-congratulation.  It was for me a very satisfying read (and one perhaps more valuable because I had read Chatwin and Theroux already).  I was disappointed to find Pattersons book so poorly reviewed here, because I felt many of things for which he is taken to task are precisely the things that made his efforts so valuable and worthy.  I think if you are interested in the art of travel rather than perhaps its faultless execution, you would do well to have a look at this book.      ',nonspam
' A102KJ9K5Q20PA	0140247602	July 25, 2001	6	6	5.0	Powerful, evocative work	 The Rwandan massacres seemed to barely make the news cycle in the United States, and while our government shamefully refused to take any action to prevent the massacres, many international news organizations placed reporters in jeopardy to uncover the events of that harrowing month.  Feargal Keanes book is a very personal and immediate account of what happened in his time reporting on the attempted genocide.  While I do agree with other reviewers that his account does not attempt to place the regional tensions into a broader context (like Gourevitchs excellent "We regret to inform you..."), it does more to involve the reader in the stinging reality of what was happening at the very moment of the crisis.    His fear is palpable, and as he drives up to each roadblock, his writing conveys the uncertainly of that situation, of the drunk soldiers, of those in the bush trying to avoid them, etc.  It is this immediacy that makes the book so valuable in my mind, that it puts you so close to the nightmare as it was happening makes this an unforgettable and immensely distressing read.  It is these kinds of images, written or drawn, that might move our leaders to act.      ',nonspam
' A102KJ9K5Q20PA	1568581688	June 27, 2001	6	8	2.0	Strangely dispassionate and haunted work	 I read this book after hearing it recommended on NPR.  It was hard when coming to the book to disassociate Kauffmanns incredible and horrible experiences as a hostage in Beirut from my appreciation of the book itself.  Every piece of ennui, every flat, sad phrase seemed to take me back to the chair in which he was blindfolded and chained for three years.  I think it would be impossible not to attribute some significance to his past, but it is something Kauffmann fails to address in any way at all.  (It is mentioned only in passing on the book jacket.)   What we find instead is a troubled man coming to terms with a troubled place.  But here his insights arent very deep.  He seems utterly amazed that this place, so far away from anywhere, is still France.  This is an glimpse into the Gallic mindset that perhaps only an Englishman could appreciate.  He also feels very impressed with being there.  He seems to pinch himself a lot.  Wow, I am in Kerguelen!  Apparently, its windy.  His attempts at a back story -- his attempts to show why this place has haunted him for so long are unconvincing and rather dull.  He includes what history he could find about the place, but, sadly, there isnt so much.  For an example of this type of writing at its finest, I would check out Bruce Chatwins In Patagonia and Kevin Pattersons excellent The Water Inbetween.  Both of these books come from similar emotional places, but engage the reader in more interesting and varied ways.      ',nonspam
' A102KJ9K5Q20PA	0805055347	June 19, 2001	1	2	3.0	Difficult, ambitious work	 There is so much that is lovely and fascinating about this book, that it is especially sad that it fails to come together on so many levels.  Others reviewers have, rightly in my view, criticized her cryptic style.  She tends to use pronouns in the place of names so frequently that often it is difficult to know who did what to whom, and while her use of Dayak words can give a sense of place, the glossary in the back is so incomplete that it became a running joke for me to spot the occasional word that is defined.  Characters drop into and out of the narrative with such amazing speed that recognizing their names when they die seems almost a triumph -- and they do tend to die.  Godshalk spends almost all of her emotional capital by the end of the book. While each of these elements contributes to ones overall frustration with the book, the larger problems emerge with the narrative.  We view the story first from Gideon Barrs perspective until he marries and we take up his wifes view.  Barr disappears, as a rounded character, in favour of the wife, who despite what seems like a great effort on Godshalks part, never becomes one.  She remains a largely passive figure, whos tribulations and mental anguish become the central focus of the book.  Much of this reads like a bloated exercise for a creative writing class -- and often makes the books four hundred pages seem interminably longer.   The fact that Godshalk puts fictional characters into a real time and place, usurping the fascinating people whose story is apt to be more interesting is itself problematic, but I couldnt help feeling for the great naturalist Alfred Russell Wallace who becomes, in Godshalks hands, a sort of lovesick puppy.

' A102KJ9K5Q20PA	0743214587	June 13, 2001	4	4	4.0	Promising start	 It seems that everyone is writing a naval series these days.  I know my paperboy started one and the guy at the video store looks to be publishing his third.  It would seem then that you would have to be doing something pretty special to justify a new series -- especially when you consider the works of Forester and OBrian.   I think Stockwin is trying for something special, in part by setting this his first story in the ranks of common sailors, but also from taking the naval aspect of these stories very seriously.  You do get a healthy sense of sea life in this tale, though you are often frustrated by the very limitations of this life.  It is hard to get a bigger picture of things precisely because these sailors were largely in the dark.  This sense that anything can happen out of the blue often gives the story a kind of disjointed feel, as if each episode is unconnected with the rest.  Moreover, there are a lot of episodes.   Despite this, and a sense that Stockwin is a much better observer of naval life than human character, the story was often gripping and the narrative never flagged.  If you havent read Patrick Obrians novels, I would start there first before considering Kydd, but with the passing of Obrian and the Aubrey-Maturin series, Kydd warrants a serious look. I wish there were room for half-stars, because three and a bit seems right to me.      ',nonspam
' A102KJ9K5Q20PA	0060188804	June 8, 2001	6	6	5.0	Greed with a human face	 The title seems to me all wrong, but thats about the only complaint I have about this informative, fascinating peek into the last forty or so years of Congos history.  Mobutu was no Kurtz, even if he might have been something worse, and the few parallels drawn do not advance the themes of the book itself.   This is a minor complaint, since the book itself is remarkably engaging.  By combining a first person perspective on many of the events surrounding Mobutus last days in office with interviews of the significant players in the Mobutu regime, Wrong is able to paint a broad canvass of those factors that led both to the creation of Mobutu the president and the myths and realities that surround him.  Its a fascinating job, and an enlightening one.  I, for one, am less enamored of being a dictator than I once was, and certainly more appreciative of those factors, both within a country and without that contribute to their existence. I think however the true glory of this book comes not from the sweeping sociopolitical account of Mobutus years in powers, but rather from the delicate handling of the details which define life under a totalitarian third world regime.  Wrong has a wonderful eye for these things, both within her own experience but also how they manifest themselves in the lives of the downtrodden and impoverished.  As the book moves into its final third Wrongs attention to these details fades under the pressure for a resolution that, at least for the people of Congo, never comes.      ',nonspam

I have never laughed so hard at a game. Ever since, Ive been trying to find my own copy of the game...and havent found until now. I heard they had stopped making it. Fortunately, here it is!

You then choose whether you got most, some or none of the votes for each question. The person with the most points wins. (Just being a little tyke in the late 70s Im still confused as to why I got all of the votes for the 70s question.) I have played this game with close friends and even with people I have just met.

It is great music to listen to and enjoy, relaxing or getting work done. I confess that I still think American Beauty is his best work.

' A102P9UKBY9P75	0679729453	November 6, 2005	3	3	5.0	A Telling Introduction to LBJ	 Bring up the topic of LBJ among those who directly experienced his Presidency and youll find responses which mirror so much of what youll hear about our current President: people either loved him or hated him. The politically charged events which marked his administration elicited the strong responses from even the most apathetic American citizen.   Robert Caros biography on LBJ has been critically acclaimed as one of the most detailed and introspective accounts not only of Lyndon Johnson, but of the political period within which this man operated.  This first volume introduces us to the future President by providing us with a theme that runs throughout the series: the dualism of LBJ - his profound vision and desire to raise up the common man vs. his profound lust for power and control and the lengths he would go to attain that power. Throughout the story we are also provided with glimpses into others who came to weave their lives with LBJ: Sam Rayburn, FDR, John Connally, and Lady Bird Johnson  For a majority of this book, Robert Caro had intimate access to many of LBJs closest confidants, including Lady Bird for a brief time. This research and work is telling from the beginning. From his humble beginnings as the son of state legislator fighting the corporate interests which controlled the state legislature to his eventual election to Congress and finally his first loss in a strongly contested bid for Senator; this duality is expressed again and again and again.  It is this focus which is the books greatest strength and its most telling weakness. The events of LBJs life, LBJs personal response to those challenges, and the repercussions/success as a result of that resonse are told in a stark black and white which can sometimes border on vilification. Other times, such as his striving to obtain federal funding for the construction of Mansfield Dam, exemplify his desire to raise up the common man while still building up personal influenc with the powerful Brown and Root company. This starkness is not only exemplified in his political exploits, but through his personal family life.

' A102P9UKBY9P75	0316011770	October 29, 2005	3	8	5.0	Historical Fiction at its Finest	 From the dusty cobblestone roads of 15th century Romania to bustling streets of 1940s Istanbul, The Historian pulls its reader through a suspenseful tale of one couples obsession with discovering the origins of Dracula. Little do they know how terrifying and how dangerous such an inquiry can be.  Elizabeth Kostova has created a fantastic story which follows the same path as Dan Browns Da Vinchi Code in that the book brings in so many elments of historical scholarship and presents this information in such a way as to make it appear as fact. It is clearly evident that a good deal of real historical study about Vlad the Impaler, the history of the vampire folktale, and the Turkish incursion into Europe in the 15th century was done.  The book opens excellently with a fairly simple beginning: a young girl discovers a book in her fathers library whose roots lie deep in the past of eastern Europe. From this simple beginning the beginnings of an excellent horror-filled drama takes the reader on slowly building puzzle while the main characters fit more and more pieces into the puzzle of who Vlad the Impaler was.   What I enjoyed so much about this book is the gradual increase in suspense that Kostova is able to produce in a way that keeps you wanting to turn the next page. The story is told in a very unique way which I feel is a nod to Bram Stokers famous Dracula story.   If you are looking for an action-oriented story with overly dramatic vampire hunters seeking their prey with all sorts of gadgets, gizmos, and relics of protection then this is not the story for you. The main characters are historians and anthropologists, the settings are old, fatigued libraries and lecturehalls, as well as serene monastaries and damp forgotten crypts. Along the way youll visit many of the great capitols of eastern Europe set during the height of the Cold War. Througout all runs the main current: if you wish to exlore the past, make sure it does not jump out of the centuries to find you.      ',spam
' A102P9UKBY9P75	B00003CXR4	October 26, 2005	3	3	5.0	One of Movies Greats	 Considered by many to among the best foreign films ever to grace the Academy Awards. This movie consistently ranks in the highest categories of cinematic excellence. Crounching Tiger Hidden Dragon is a fantastic tale rich in story, beauty, and character.  Together, Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh provide a terrific performance which focuses on love, honor, and devotion. The tale is both simple and complex. The story revolves around a sword called the Green Destiny. This weapons strength is as well known as its owner: the great warrior Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat). When this sword is stolen by an anonymous skilled fighter, Li Mu Bai and Shu Lein (Michelle Yeoh) track down the thief only to discover that the rogue is actually the daughter of a high ranking Beijing official with a very unique past of her own. Overarching all of this is Li Mu Bais quest to avenge his fallen master, killed at the hands of a wicked sorcerous named Jade Fox.   While the story does revolve around a sword: the Green Destiny, the focus is on the nature of power, the danger of reckless use of power, and the need for discipline to obtain true strength.   The cinematography sets a strong mood for the film with overtly fantastical martial arts that is both a joy to watch and is yet another way in which the film stresses its main points. Points which are narrowed down fairly succintly in a quote by Li Mu Bai:  "No growth without assistance. No action without reaction. No desire without restraint"  A simply superb soundtrack overlays the film which is orchestrated by the great Yo Yo Mah. The music acts adds not only to the dramatic moments of the scene, but carries the viewer along during the more leisurely transitional moments of the film. I highly recommend not only the movie, but also this soundtrack.  I can not stress this enough: Buy this movie. The story is great, the environment is rich, the music is superb, and the acting is superb. Youll rarely find a gem that will shine brighter in your collection.      ',spam
' A102P9UKBY9P75	B000AARKOO	October 26, 2005	5	6	4.0	Dramatized History, But Loses Something in the Translation	 The greatest strength of Kingdom of Heaven is also its greatest liability. Ridley Scotts expensive attempt at recreating one of the many great battles by the West over control of the Holy Land is magnificent in scope, stunning in its presentation, and strong in its telling. Its greatest problem, though, is that it tackles too much and thus is unable to fully flesh out the issues that are presented and then bring these issues to resolution.  As a result, the disjointed complexity which seems prevalent throughout the movie becomes its distinguishing feature. There is not one overall message, but many which all require resolution in 2 and a half hours. These include:  1. a mans journey of redemption and salvation (never really resolved) 2. examining the nature of Jerusalem and its inhabitants as a Holy City of 3 distinct religions: Judaism, Islam and Christianity.  3. exemplifying the harsh nature of life in the desert 4. profiling the diverse nature of the Crusaders and the task of the King to maintain this organized chaos. 5. Humanizing both armies and the leaders (Balian, Saladin)  On top of this, many of the characters are historical recreations with political events which are drawn from actual events which occurred in politically charged Jerusalem of the 12th century.  That being said there are many characteristics of this movie which are good.   The cinematography is simply excellent. When a person conjures a picture of the crusades in their heads the picture which Kingdom of Heaven portrays is perhaps as close as youre going to get to that mental image. Knights in armor baking and dying outright from exhaustion as they march to the approaching Muslim army, the salty Sicilean port of Messina, and finally, over all, the dusty walled city of Jersalem with its eclectic, diverse population, its massive fortifications and walls, and its focus as spiritual home for so many people.   The acting is fanastic in some regards and falls short in others. Liam Neeson is portrayed in his typical mentor/father figure and excels at it despite having relatively short screen time. Eva Greens character seems to represent more than she is able to portray and, as a result, her character falls short. Edward Norton as the Leper King does a simply magnificent job despite being completely covered. Finally, there is the main character in Orlando Bloom. His overt stoicism and melacholy throughout the film just doesnt seem to carry over well. Perhaps its because we have typecast him into more jovial/lighthearted roles or maybe its because he simply does a better job when theres atleast a little fun involved (Pirates and Lord of the Rings comes to mind), but he just doesnt seem to come across as well as he has in his previous movies.   Overall, I give this movie 4 stars because it really is a monumental effort by Ridley Scott. I saw and understood what he was trying to do with this film, but trying to make a film on a topic as massive and culturally charged as the Crusades which requires historians many books to thread the true tale was simply too much even for this well respected director. It is a great topic, but as a movie it takes on more than it needs to chew.      ',nonspam
' A102P9UKBY9P75	0786901640	October 13, 2005	0	0	2.0	Another Great Opportunity Falls Short	 There was something almost magical about the final battle in The Crystal Shard. The build up throughout the book had been well constructed, the characters were deep and the environment was simply unique. The climactic battles of Ten Towns concurrent with the personal battles of the main characters were blended together in a way where you genuinely cared about what happened to them.  How I wish R.A. Salvatore would return to those days. Instead, we have The Siege of Darkness. Book three in a sad series that seems to get worse as it goes on. To say it was a drudge to get through this one is an understatement.  This book has two plot lines: the "Time of Troubles" and the attack by the Drow army on Mithril Hall. Im still trying to figure out Salvatores justification for the "Time of Troubles". This brief moment that comes at just the right time seems completely forced as the only possible way he could tie up a loose story end.  The real event is the Drow army advance and eventual attack. All of the subplots, all of the characterization, all of the book is spent building up for this final climactic moment. When it eventually comes, the battle doesnt really live up to its expectations and the characters individual ruminations just fall flat out.  Instead of hardy barbarians, we are treated to the likes of Pwent and his battleragers and more of the Harpells. This leads to another problem I have with this book: way too much comic relief. It seems that every single time Salvatores plot seems to be dragging he puts in another silly moment like the battleragers running into stone walls for practice, or a recently cured Biderdoo Harpell wishing he had his former curse back so he could be a dog again. While some moments are genuinely funny, Salvatore seems to include these moments at inopportune times and as a result they seem more as a filler or as a way to shore up a loose plot line.  The final half of this book really is just about the drow vs. dwarf battle. Its long, its drawn out, but it does have some shining moments. Salvatores strength has always been his ability to write a clear action story.   The focus, of course, is always on the leaders and their impossible exploits which bring them fame and victory. Ss with all Salvatore books you always know Drizz and company are going to win, and if by some freak chance someone gets killed *cough* Wulfgar *cough* you know that character is coming back later. They always do. Just talk to Artemis.   Which leads me to my final point. I will read Passage of Dawn and I will hope that things make a change, but if I dont see improvement this will be the last Salvatore series I pick up. This entire series seems forced and perhaps as I read other reviews it makes sense. If Salvatore was forced to write this to appease TSR it only makes sense that all of his heart wouldnt go into it.      ',nonspam
' A102P9UKBY9P75	1560768800	October 13, 2005	1	4	3.0	A Great Start, But Not So Great Finish	 After coming off a really good start with The Legacy, I really feel that for the exception of a few brief moments, this book is really the weakest of the entire series: weakest in terms of plot, character, and just general storytelling.   As is becoming a trend in Salvatore books from an author that simply cant let go of a character Artemis Entreri, the same Artemis Entreri that was supposed to have died...twice...  Despite its miscomings later on, the book actually begins rather well: Bruenor is crushed at the loss of Wulfgar, Drizzt is concerned about the Dark Elves intentions, and Catti Brie is still trying to figure out what to do with herself since she thought she was already going to be married by this book.   The book can be essentially broken down into two main plots: Drizzt/Catti Brie in Mithril Hall and Drizzt/Catti Brie/Artemis Entreri in Menzoberranzan. The first plot is strong and really builds on the characters. The second is simply a series of challenges for the trio which increase in intensity with the climactic moment being so over the top as to really catapult all 3 of these characters into the realm of fantasy Superheroes: they are invincible and unscated in the face of overwhelming odds.  Drizzts ruminations as he decides to make the trip to his former homeland are where Salvatore is really able to bring about the overconfidence of his main character, an overconfidence which is built on well throughout this book. Drizzts eventual capture and torture were fantastic opportunities for Salvatore to begin to show the real inner strength and, finally, limitations of Drizzt. Instead, this is where the book begins to slide down into the realm of superhero comicbook farce.   From the rescue of Drizzt by Artemis and Catti Brie to the Epilogue the trio faces simply impossible odds and still manages to escape the jaws of Menzoberranzan without a single scrape and quite a bit of loot to boot. With the whirling scimitars of Drizzt, the whirling knives of Artemis, and the unlimited ammo, ballista shotgun that is the bow of Cattie Brie (oh ya, she also now has a sword that can cut through stone and probably solid steel too): the trio are simply invincible.  I cant really place it, but Ive lost some respect for these books after reading this one. I know going in what to expect: a relatively light read with some dramatic moments. I know that the main characters are all going to come back at some point because Salvatore just cant let them go. Despite this, I feel this story really is missing something. Perhaps it borders on being too fantastical, perhaps its the overly dramatic moments which really dont come across well, or maybe its just that the fight scenes in the previous two series just seemed a lot more gritty.   What I think it basically boils down to is theres only so many times where you can see characters go through hell and come back out before it loses its novelty.      ',nonspam
' A102P9UKBY9P75	1560766409	September 21, 2005	0	1	4.0	The Legend of Drizzt Continues	 This first book in a series entitled Legacy of the Drow is the true sequel to Icewind Dale, but really requires the reader to be familiar with both the Icewind Dale Trilogy, as well as the Dark Elf Trilogy to understand the variety of different characters, both good and evil, which inhabit its pages.  I found this book to be in the same vein as its predecessors. Its main focus remains on Drizzt DoUrden, Bruenor, Catti-bree, Wulfgar, and Regis as well as Drizzts enemies: his old family and the true villain: Artemis Entreri.   Salvatores greatest strength is through his detailed action sequences and the strong life which he breathes into his characters. As Ive said in reviews of his previous works, this tends to create an almost superhuman quality to the stories heroes making them seem larger than life...even for a fantasy. You find yourself less and less concerned with the plot and look forward to the intricate battle sequences and one vs. ones, a plot focus which Salvatore seems to rely on heavily throughout the book.  New to the scene is villian Jaraxle: a mercenary drow who manipulates the various houses behind the scene. This character goes on to feature prominently throughout the series and really takes a backstage roll to the real villain of this story: Artemis Entreri. Also new is hero side-kick: Pwent the battlerager. This characters seems more of a comic relief to break up the relatively somber mood of the main heroes.  The Legacys tale is fraught with death, destruction, and grief as true disaster finally is vested upon the group of friends.   The story is relatively strong and breaks with Salvatores previous works in its very somber portrayal of Drizzt finally coming into contact with members of his sinister race. Drow who are hellbent on seeing Drizzt be sacrificed to the glory of Lloth.  While important plot sequences for the entire Legacy of the Drow series do occur, they are few: this book seems only as a mechanism to provide introduction to a few new characters, works as a means ferment chaos within the original group of friends, and introduces the justification for storylines of future books in the series.  Overall, I give this story 4 stars because while it does contain solid character and battle descriptions, you tend to realize that everything aside from the main characters is fluff to be discarded simply to move along the plot.

' A102P9UKBY9P75	0393307050	September 15, 2005	4	4	5.0	A Masterful (Har Har) Tale of Life on the High Seas	 The Aubrey Maurin Series kicks off in grand fashion with this, the first book: Master and Commander. I was first made aware of this book by watching the movie and because interested enough to purchase it. I was not in store for both the entertaining and frustrating moments which awaited me.  Its hard for me to place exactly how I feel about this book at present. I just finished it today so perhaps more thought could have gone into this review, but I usually feel that these initial feelings are correct.   The book begins in Port Mahon, a British controlled island off the eastern coast of Spain. We are introduced to the two main characters (Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin) rather quickly and are then whisked off into the world of 1800 Europe. Patrick OBrian did a simply fantastic job of writing this book in a fashion that a contemporary literate seaman of the 1800s would be able to understand it completely. Rigging and locations in the ship are presented with very little explanation from the very beginning and I found myself (like others in these reviews) quickly lost in the technical jargon that so heavily populates this entire series. While you do begin to have some familiarity with all of this it is still good to have some nautical dictionary nearby in order to gain a better understanding.   I most enjoyed the detailed descriptions OBrian uses to give as accurate a picture as possible of life on the seas: its cramped, its loud, its dangerous. OBrien is able to capture a fantastic picture that is used as a backdrop to exemplify the exploits of Jack Aubrey and his hot headed Lieutenant James Dillon as they capture French and Spanish ships in daring raids against impossible odds.   There are two characteristics of this book which I found to be most problematic:   The first being the the extreme use of nautical terminology which can be extremely confusing if you are not intimately familiar with sailing ships. I found myself quickly lost in the two climactic moments at the end which involve multipe ships because I simply had no idea what was going on aside from a lot of death and destruction.   The second problem is the extraordinarily abrupt changing of events which OBrian uses throughout the book. The reader can be whisked to opposite ends of the boat to a different persons perspective seemingly without warning. This occurs regularly and requires the reader to constantly go back a few pages to find out when the transition occurred.   As an addendum, I have heard that Post Captain (the 2nd book) is a little more easy to follow.  Overall, though, I recommend this book as a fantastic forray into historical fiction. While you do need some interest in the topic to help carry you through, if you have that youll find a great adventure ahead of you and many additional books to carry you through.       ',spam
' A102P9UKBY9P75	B00005EBA0	September 14, 2005	11	12	5.0	Simply the Greatest Board Game of all Time	 Diplomacy has a storied history. Former President Kennedy and Henry Kissinger are known to have played the game back in their college days. The game itself is in the category of games like Monopoly that have remained unchanged throughout the many years of its existance. This is in part due both to the complexity and the simplicity of the game.  Diplomacy is a strategic boardgame in the same vein as Risk layout-wise which begins in 1900 Europe. The game can be played by a maximum of 7 players who each represent one of the majors powers before the outbreak of World War I: England, France, Russia, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Turkey and Italy.  Each power begins with relatively few units on the board (3-4 depending on the power) so it is of critical importance what you do with them. There are two types: fleets and armies. Each unit only has a power of 1 so in order to attack another person you need to have secured an ally to aid you in this endeavor. This diplomacy is the basis for the game.  Turns proceed as follows: each turn represents either the fall or spring of a specific year. For a certain length of time there is a diplomatic session. During this time you consult with the other players in an attempt to negotiate the moves of your units. At the end of time each person writes down the moves for their units and then play occurs simultaneously.  Either organized chaos or finely tuned play proceeds. This game relies totally upon your ability to be able to work within the various plans of your allies and enemies, to be able to recognize when to ally with certain people and to be able to recognize when that alliance is no longer needed. Backstabbing is common. This is definitely not a game you can take personally.  I have found the greatest joy of this game to be in the sheer negotiations. DMZs crop up all over the board as powers discuss how they will aid and destroy each other. In the space of 20 minutes you can discuss 5 different plans with 5 different people, but only upon revealing the moves will the trust come out: who is with you and who is against you.  To put it plainly: it is the best board game I have ever played and I highly recommend it.      ',nonspam

The object of this game is to colonize the continent of Cataan using roads and settlements. The settlements and upgraded cities give you points with the winner being the first person to 10 points.   The board is a circular hexagonal board. Each hex (for the exception of the perimeter hexes which are water and deserts) produces 1 of 5 different resources.  Settlements are placed at locations where the hexs meet and roads run along the hex edges. Each hexagon is given a number which will give the player one unit of that resource.  Settlements are built using resources which are obtained by rolling 2 dice and then consulting the board. Wherever that number lies a resource is produced if your settlement/city lies on its hexcorner.   At its core, this game is a practice in trading. Throughout the game the person who trades the most is able to generate enough resources to expand out by building additional raods and settlements. Seaports provide additional means of trade  The strategy of this game is determining the supply and demand factors which will most likely occur and then placing your settlements in a manner which will be most advantageous to your victory.  This is a fantastic game perfect for the family, friends and pretty much anyone who has an interest in very basic supply and demand economics. It has not only an entertaining component, but can serve as a great introduction into the foundations of economic principles.      ',nonspam

Despite having owned it for over 2 years we still regularly play matches on what have become almost memorized courses.   This game was a follow-up for a very successful first version which was released for the Nintendo 64 about 5 years ago. You choose a member of the Mario series cast of characters, each having different strengths and weaknesses, and then play on one of the many courses which will open up for you as you continue to play the game. Not only are courses unlockable, but different playstyles, new characters, a "star" ability which allows a character to hit further, and other types of games.   Gameplay: Very solid and intuitive. The heads up display provides a wealth of information.   Graphics: The graphics are similar to the cartoony 3-d style that make up most of the Mario series of games. The courses themselves are richly detailed and provide an easy way to tell heigth and depth. Very easy on the eye.  Sound: Many of the sounds you hear from other Mario games are present. Each character has a series of taunts which you can use to unnerve an opponent. The music is low key and provides good background.  Replayability: This game has drawn me back again and again for the past 2 years. That says enough.      ',nonspam
' A102P9UKBY9P75	0671728687	September 6, 2005	5	7	4.0	A Good "Starter" for World War II Studies	 It is hard to adequately review a book that is almost 1,150 pages in length without missing at least some detail that is critical to the assessment. That being said heres my review:  This book was written in 1960 and draws most of its substance from a list of sources which Shirer describes in the Foreword. These include many of the remaining OKW and Nazi HQ documents which the Allies confiscated in the capture of Germany. Additional sources include first hand accounts by those surviving Germany generals who escaped the death penalty at Nuremburg. It does not, however, contain the more recent military history that was released with the fall of the Soviet Union.  Rise and Fall was a mammoth undertaking for its time both in scope and in size. Its greatest strength lies in its ability to describe, in detail, the many major events of the war from the rise of the National Socialist party under Hitler and Rhoen to the Russian counteroffensive into Berlin. Its main focus is on the political history of both the Nazi party and Nazi Germany itself; the main players are the leaders of the great powers at the time: Neville Chamberlain, Molotov and Stalin, Churchill, Roosevelt; the leaders of the Nazi party: Hitler, Goering, Goebbels, Himmler; and the leaders of the Germany army: Jodl, Keitel, Rommel and others.   Most of this book concerns what lead to World War II and how those events are what led to September 1, 1939. The actual events of the war take up only a small portion of this book as they serve as a backdrop and catalyst for the political maneuverings of all the above mentioned individuals. Throughout the book the main emphasis remains Adolf Hitler: his rise to power, his anti-Semitism, his ruminations in Mein Kaumf and his megalomania.   I highly recommend this as a good "starter" book for World War II. All of the main characters are intimately described, all of the major events are very thoroughly detailed, and the book covers the entire war. Finally, the book is written in a dramatic fashion which makes it a great page turner and helps get you through the sheer size of a book which will need atleast 2 months to really read.

Brands does a really great job of combinding fantastic storytelling with historical fact in a way that is both entertaining and will provide the reader with a good grasp of how Texas became both a nation and eventually a state.  What this book does is trace the origins of both the anglo and hispanic populations of Texas beginning with folks like Moses Austin and later Stephen F. Austin, profiles the greats of Texas history such as Sam Houston, William Travis, and Davy Crockett as well as those on the other side of the conflict: Santa Anna and Martin de Cos.  The main argument of this book is that the revolutionary war in Texas was a disorganized shamble that blundered its way to freedom. Such disasters as the Alamo and Gonzales could have been avoided or were not really necessary in retrospect, but what they provided were key events that a lot of settlers could draw motivation from. The eventual victory at San Jacinto is told from a different standpoint that you wont find in traditional Texas history books.   What Brands is trying to do is both dispel the myths of the Texas revolution while trying to shed a little light on what actually happened. He does so in a very good way while still giving credit where credit was due. All in all, I highly recommend this book. Its a good general overview and is told in such a way as to keep you turning the pages.      ',spam
' A102P9UKBY9P75	0140284583	July 27, 2005	11	12	5.0	A Window onto a War Torn City	 Stalingrad by Anthony Beevor is a fantastic read for a person itnerested in a very specific battle in World War II which, without question, was as major a turning point in World War II as El Alamein and D-Day.   The book opens with the beginning of Operation Barbarrosa, Hitlers ill-fated decision to break the non-agression pact of 1939 with Russia. What commences for the next 1/2 of the book is a detailed analysis of the events which transpired to bring the Germany army to Stalingrad and the banks of the Volga. The failed attempt against Moscow, the major tank battle of Kursk, and the siege of Stalingrad are explained thoroughly with all the major players (military and political) given their time in the sun.   The 3rd quarter of the book deals mainly with explaining the environment of the war torn city, how the basic soldier and civilian was able to survive, and the lengths to which the Soviet Army would go to maintain the pressure on the German Army. While the major events surrounding Stalingrad were interesting, I found these brief chapters to be the most interesting and gritty of the book.  The last fourth of the book deals with the conclusion of the battle and the subsequent counterattack and complete encirclement of the German 6th Army. Again, while the sequences which lead to these events are interesting, I found Beevors explanation of how the basic German soldier found a way to survive (or didnt) on the cold steppes of the Russian plain completely surrounded in the tight Soviet Kessel to be quite unique. I especially enjoyed all of the soldier diary entries and personal accounts that Beevor draws on to paint as close a picture as he can.  Overall, I am very pleased with this book and feel it does deserve the 5 star rating. One note of caution: this is not a book for someone wishing to get an introduction into World War II. For that I would recommend Shirers The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich or, if you prefer something more recent, Rich Atkinsons Dawn of War. Both will give you great introductions on the conflict, what shaped it into being, and the major players involved.       ',nonspam

This, of course, leads to some very biased presentations of the facts in order to present Abraham Lincoln in as positive and liberal a light as possible. Missing is the fact that Lincoln was forced to write the Emancipation Proclimation in order to appease the strong Abolitionist wing of the Republican party and other such instances where Lincoln was not the brightest Presidential star. While I do think that within the pantheon of Presidents, Abe Lincoln definitely ranks up there with George Washington, and FDR as one of the greatest Presidents, I also think that a book that is trying to present a case for Lincoln should focus less on the present occupier of the White House and more on the former. Cuomo simply makes it too obvious that this entire book is one enormously jaded propoganda piece for the Democratic party. The true parts on Lincoln doesnt even begin until 50 pages into the work because the author is too busy talking about all that is wrong with the current Republican-lead government in Washington.   I consider myself a Democrat and see the importance of the role of the federal government, but this book should focus more on what Lincoln did right to change his own age and how that went on to impact American down to the present period and less on what he might have done had he been alive today.

' A102P9UKBY9P75	0664223494	May 16, 2005	1	1	4.0	A Scholarly Review of the 3 Gospels: Mark, Matthew and Luke	 This book presents an analysis of the 3 Synoptic Gospels: Mark, Matthew, and Luke through the use of "Form Criticism". The basic argument behind this literary criticism is that since these 3 gospels each follow the same basic narrative of the story of Christ, a careful study of the similarities and differences of each of them can lead to indications  which community the author was addressing his gospel to, when the author was perhaps writing his gospel, and finally can provide indications on how his portrait of Christ addresses the various challenges of Christianity that the author and his community was facing at that time period.   Keith Nickles presents his argument in a very logical manner which is both easy to follow, but gives a good introductory basis not only for the information he is trying to present, but also to allow the reader to delve into the New Testament themselves in order to gain a better understanding.   One important piece of information which any potential reader should take note of is the fact that Keith Nickles does present this book on the theory that Mark was written first and that Matthew and Luke were both using a copy of Mark and another document/collection of oral traditions commonly called "Q" in each of their writings of the gospels. Nickles belief is that the gospels originated as oral traditions/Jesus one-liners/written bits and pieces and that Mark first took these various elements and combined it into the basic story of Christ which was circulating among the various early Christian communities of the era. This anonymous author of Mark did this both to provide a secure story of Christ his community could use to learn more about Jesus, but also to address concerns his community had over various challenges they were faced with.   I found this book to be very enjoyable and a good introduction to modern Biblical scholorship. It did not get a 5 star rating because I have spoken with other Biblical scholars who provide just as good an argument that Matthew was written first or that Luke perhaps was. The point is no one will ever really know for sure, but Nickles is able to present his argument for why he believes Mark was created first in a way that is both convincing and informative.

' A102P9UKBY9P75	B00000K0FY	May 10, 2005	0	0	3.0	The Best World War II Strategy Boardgame on the Market	 Axis and Allies is a board game set during World War II which allows 2-5 players to assume the roles of the great powers of the global spanning conflict of 1945: Germany, the United States, Great Britain, Russia, and Japan.   The board is a replication of the world split into various zones which correspond to either direct land holdings for that power in the form of colonial governments or through intercession such as British Africa.   The game consists of many different land, air and sea-based units which have different offensive and defensive capabilities which are purchased through a monetary system controlled by how much land you have acquired.   This game generally takes atleast 2-4 hours with a lengthy set up due to the sheer amount of starting units that need to be placed ont he board prior to starting. Combat is conducted via a series of dice rolls in a unit vs. unit fashion.  The game itself plays out fantastically and really requires the player to carefully consider every move to a degree which simply isnt necessary in most board games. It adds a facet to the game which has been one of the big reasons for its great popularity over the years.  This newer version is more balanced than the previous and is played on a slightly different map. Additionally, certain units such as the tank and plane have been modified. New units include the artillery and destroyer (both carry overs from A&A: Europe and A&A: Pacific).  All in all, a very fun thinking game which I highly recommend for a group of players who have the patience to play the game.      ',nonspam
' A102P9UKBY9P75	078691811X	April 13, 2005	1	1	5.0	The Classic Fantasy Trilogy	 R. A. Salvatore can be credited with single handedly bringing The Forgotten Realms and Drizzt DoUrden into the minds and hearts of fantasy lovers everywhere. Being one of his first serious works, The Icewind Dale trilogy is a fun and action packed story with its strongest trait being the extraordinarily detailed characters that inhabit its pages.   The first book tells the tale of a community located in the ice filled north. These harsh conditions set the tone for a book filled with magical beings, dragons, and fantasy races of all kinds (namely dwarves, humans, elves, and dark elves). While the central conflict remains the defense of Ten Towns against a maddened wizard, what the story really focuses on is the central characters: Wulfgar the Barbarian, Drizzt the dark elf ranger, Bruenor the dwar, Catti-Brie the mage, and Regis the halfling.   The second book whisks the main characters off to the warmer and more dangerous southern coasts along the Sea of Swords. Salvatore increases his boundaries and really fleshes out the world he is slowly creating. It is really in this book that the story begins to really focus on Drizzt DoUrden: his past, his present, and his future. Some critics have stated that Salvatore focuses almost too much on this much-loved dark elf. I would tend to agree, but that does not mean that this wonderful character and his night-filled past isnt worth exploring.   The concluding book in the trilogy remains (in my opinion) the least powerful of the three books, while introducing one of the more enjoyable villains who goes on to become a regular feature of future Salvatore books: Artemis Entreri. As with the other two books, you find yourself less and less caring about the overall story and just waiting for the time to come around when Drizzt and Artemis are going to square off.   The work itself exemplifies what R.A. Salvatore is very good at: creating characters that are filled with emotions, experiences, and character that are put in situations where you learn more and more about them. What you find is that you could care less about the overall story and look forward to the interactions between these very diverse people as they interact (or sometimes are forced to interact) with each other.   Overall, I recommend this book as a fun-filled summer read which is relatively light, but full of adventure. As the characters, especially Drizzt, hack and slash their way through hordes of undead, goblins, dragons and demons they endear themselves to you in a way where you want to pick up the next trilogy just to see where they will go next. In a way, these characters are the equivalent of fantasy superheroes and the story is almost a drawn out comic book in that the characters may find themselves tore apart, but they always manage to come back and save the day.   The one discredit I will give this book is that it, along with The Dragonlance Chronicles, began the era of cookie-cutter fantasy books which now fill the shelves of numerous bookstores around the country. Dragonlance is particularly prone to this problem. That being the case you have to be very selective in your choosing a book set in either of these two realms as you never know the quality of the story you are about to read. With that in mind though, a rich world full of delightful characters await the reader who turns their mind onto The Icewind Dale Trilogy.       ',spam

' A102P9UKBY9P75	0441172717	April 13, 2005	0	0	5.0	One of the Greats of Science Fiction	 Hailed as one of the greatest works of science fiction in the history of the genre, this book, along with other writers such as Arthur C. Clark and Ray Bradbury, is definitely in a select company. While so much is written on how much it impacted science fiction, I find the focus of the book to be on both science and religion. The messianic journey of Paul Atredies to his ascendancy as the Muad Dib of the Fremen peoples and of the planet Arrakis is a tale told with a specific focus.   The style of the literature is one where important points/events are highlighted and then time jumps forward to the next important event. What we are left with to fill the holes is our own imagination at work. For example, we never read about what happens in the time period between Pauls joining of the Fremen and his eventual ascendency as a man of importance. The chapter following the end of the second part of the book is a high speed run through a series of events leading to the important reason for the third part of the book: the prophetic escalation of Paul to become leader of the desert tribes. Yet again, in the third part of the book we are not given details on how the Fremen take over Arakeen. Frank Herbert leaves the savageries of battle to our imagination. What is important is what happens both before and after.   Throughout this book we are reminded again and again that the focus is on the messianic journey of Paul along with a fantastic description of the planet where this occurred: the Arrakis. The story itself is told beautifully and through a creativity that is rarely seen, Frank Herbert is able to create a very realistic people who will eventually lead the Prophet into battle.   I would highly recommend this book to anyone wishing to become introduced to great science fiction. So many writers have borrowed from this work, that its familiarity is almost as commonplace as The Lord of the Rings. Its been tried and re-tried, but the original Dune series still stands as the quintessinial work of Science Fiction      ',spam
' A102P9UKBY9P75	0155055690	March 15, 2005	7	7	5.0	A very thorough survey of Chinese and Japanese history	 This book was specifically recommened to me by a Professor at the University of Texas as a fantastic "starter" on Chinese history. A fantastic read, this college text introduces the reader to Asian civilization in a way that provides information on both the history of Japan and China, as well as a very in-depth look at the cultures which grew out of this history. As Dr. Shirokauer clearly states in his introduction, this book serves as a survey in order to give the reader a general idea on the key aspects (both historically and culturally) of both the Japenese and Chinese civilizations. Weighing in at around 650 pages, this book is a massive undertaking in historical scholarship and provides a fantastic opportunity for the reader to gain a full understanding of Asia, while still leaving the reader thirsty for more at the end. Luckily, a thorough explanations of sources and a very large additional reading section provide avenues for those interested in Asian history to pursue specific topics.  For China, this story focuses around the various dynasties which ruled that country for so long. Beginning with the most early archealogical findings available for China and continuining through the Zhou, Song, Tang, Ming, etc... For Japan, the focus centers around the central administration of Kyoto until the creation of the Shogun and the rise in prominence of Edo (located at present-day Tokyo).   One aspect of this work which so distinguishes it from other college texts on these civilizations is its focus on the cultural aspects of these two civilizations. The author covers the evolution of art in all forms, everyday living, architecture, and religion in as detailed a fashion as he explains their history. In this way, the reader is able to see a very detailed cultural progression that stands out due to the fact that most history books only pay minor lip service to the importance of culture in a society.   I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning about a part of the world that is quickly catching up with its Western neighbors. As countries like China and Korea begin to frequent more and more national headlines, it is important to understand the key aspects which differentiate it from the West. Not only will this knowledge better inform you of how these people live, but it will provide you with a historical perspective that explains how they got there in the first place.      ',spam
' A102P9UKBY9P75	0142196029	October 24, 2004	5	12	5.0	A Book on History From A Jewish Perspective	 The first comment I would like to make on this book is that if you are looking for a book which approaches the figure of Jesus Christ from a Christian Apologist perspective, this book is not for you.   Geza Vermes approach to Jesus Christ is made very plain in the introduction: he is attempting to find the "historical" Jesus through interpretation of the New Testament, the works of contemporary writers of the time period such as Flavius Julius, and through an analysis of the culture and historical events of the time period and how that shaped the Jewish culture of the time.  He does this through an examination of Jesus in a very nontraditional manner: his focus begins with the Jesus of John and works toward the gospel of Matthew. Liturgical scholars and even the casual reader of the Bible can see a different focus given by each of the different writers of the Gospels, this difference is explained in depth by Dr. Vermes. He thoroughly explains Jewish religious traditions of the time period and ties these in to specific dialogue in scripture in order for a reader of the Bible to attempt to see this religious document through the eyes of a Jew or Greek reader of the time period.   Again, this is not a Christian apologetic work and it does not profess to be. Geza Vermes attempts, through this book, to explain Jesus Christ through the culture and events of the people he was spreading the Good News too: the Jews of Judea and Palastine.       ',spam
' A102P9UKBY9P75	0674777700	October 24, 2004	9	10	5.0	A Great Book For A General Overview	 Beginning from the military take over of Rome by Julius Caesar, through Octavian and Trajan to the eventual end of centralized government in the 3rd and 4th centuries, this book neatly organizes the material chronologically while not losing the reader in a hodge-podge of names, places, and events. Dr. Colin Wells does a fantastic job of explaining the culture of the Roman Empire both in Italy and throughout the many provinces (most notably Africa, Egypt, Asia Minor, Germania and Britannia).   A overtly general book on the period, this historical work is great for the reader that is unfamiliar with the time period and simply wants a thorough discussion on the Roman Empire that touches on all the major topics while not getting too bogged down in the nitty gritty details. Points of contention among researches are raised with Dr. Wells providing his opinion on the matters while still acknowledging the dissenting view.   Finally, the book does a really good job of capturing the feel of Rome during this time. The more enjoyable parts of the book are when he explains the cultural aspects of the Roman Empire: what life was like as a plebian, the Bay of Naples as a senatorial resort for the very rich or life as a legionnaire on the banks of the Rhine or the Danube. While he does cater to a more British audience (this book was written while Dr. Wells was teaching as an adjunct professor at Cambridge) I highly recommend it as a great "starter" book for those interested in learning about the Roman Empire.

This Pacific campaign-focused game is a great substitute for the regular game if you do not have the requisite number of players or enough time for regular Axis & Allies. The game contains 2 new units: artillery and destroyer which are great additions to the game. Additionally, inclusion of convoys, naval and air bases create an A&A game style that is quite unique and creates a variety of different strategies that can be employed throughout the map. In this way it is quite different from both Axis & Allies and Axis & Allies Europe. Every game does not end up being the same. Overall, a great game that typically takes 2 to 3 hours and has replayability value that is just as high as A&A and A&A: Europe      ',nonspam

The genius of Todd is largely due to his ability to play a multitude of instruments (guitar,piano, bass, sax etc...) ."Liars" is filled with drum machines, tape sampling etc. As a result, the "classic" Todd feeling/emotion is replaced by a synthetic sound.

John Petrucci and Mike Portnoy show off their talents at "lightening" speed. The problem here is that other Metal bands have been doing this for years (Metallica,Anthrax,Iron Maiden etc..) There are some standout tracks on TOT such as "As I Am", "Vacant"/"Stream of Consciousness" and "In The Name of GOD".Unfortunately, what lies in between is a lot of NOISE......I hope the next "train" that arrives contains the "old" DT......

' A1031R8HD3E4GL	B0000C7PRY	September 27, 2003	4	5	3.0	My Testimony....	 First, I will start off by saying Ive been a huge Beard fan since "The Light" (their first CD). Neal Morse has always been an inspiration to me , as a prolific songwriter and musician. He has created, IMHO, some of the best prog work in recent times with "Day For Night", "Kindness of Strangers" and "V". I was dissapointed with "Snow", in terms of lyrical content and song structure...I found the "2 hour format" as sounding forced at times. Neals solo effort "Testimony" , continues along this path. Only now, Neils new found Christianity, is his central theme.This disk needs to establish an identity- it struggles at times between brilliant prog and light Christian music, but does not really do justice to either.....I think Neal should deliver his messages of faith in a Christian Music focused product and still produce creative prog pieces ala "Healing Colors of Sound", "Flow", "Stranger in Your Soul" etc....Not sure Neals new "Testimony" is clear to all of us.

The excellent musicianship is still there, it jsut lacks the great melodies that Enchant is known for. Some exceptions are "Living in a Movie", "Long Way Down", and "Comatose"..There is also a great instramental appropriately named "Progtology"...New fans might enjoy, I just expected MORE....This CD was produced in less than 1 year, and it sounds rushed (no pun intended!).

The creative force of the band -Neal Morse is sorely missed! I have been a Beard fan since their first release (The Light).....Gone are the melodies, thoughtful lyrics, and ingenious arrangements of Neal....Drummer Nick DVirgillio steps up and does a credible job, but this falls far short of what weve come to expect from previous SB efforts ("V", "Kindness of Strangers", "Day For Night" etc.)Neal Morse was a TRUE musical genious.

It is about a "gifted" albinos difficult journey through life, and the struggles he encounters along the way. This could have been a brilliant CD if it was "shortened" to one rather than two CDs.......By the time the listener gets through the end of CD one, you feel like the story (and music) has already been told. Snow contains the usual consistent melodic themes that Neal Morse is known for, and the quality mucianship of the Beard..It is just TOO DAMN long, and CD 2 suffers as a result, with what appears to be "filler"....Another issue I have is the limited playing (solos) of guitarist Alan Morse. SB fans will definately enjoy this, but I wish it had "Snowed" a little less.      ',nonspam

BAF is a masterfully crafted musical journey. All four tracks blend and create the "perfect" product. "Duel With The Devil" kicks things off, with a cello lead ala Spcks Beard V...."Suite Charlotte Pike" is a Beatlesque "Abbey Road" side 2 type of piece.."Bridge Across Forever" is a poignant Neal Morse piece that is soothing, in light of whats happening in our world today...And finally, the greatest track of all, "Stranger In Your Soul" takes in the prior "journeys" and completes the "bridge".

This cd contains intraspective, highly intelligent lyrics that are numbing at times. The songs are beautifully crafted and written. Mr. Wade is definately a promising young songwriter. The music is reminiscent of Matchbox Twenty, Creed , Pearl Jam and even a little Vertical Horizon. Lifehouse maintains its own identity, however, and produces a solid product.

This is  definately my least favorite Spocks Beard effort. It seems that Neal Morse  abandoned his sense of "melodic adventure" for a heavier more  "technical" sound. As a result, "V" contains very few  memorable moments. The first cut "At The End Of The Day" starts  off promising, but rapidly deteriorates into a plodding piece. The next  four cuts contain sparse melodies, certainly nothing in the usual  "Beard tradition". The final track "The Great Nothing"  should be the title cut. This track is the best on this CD, but again falls  way short of classic SB.      ',nonspam

' A103KNDW8GN92L	B00008L3RY	February 19, 2006	0	0	5.0	An amazing story of triumph over adversity	 "My Left Foot" is a well-detailed biography of author, writer & artist Christy Brown, born with athetoid cerebral palsy. Browns life story is told in flashback form & is documented in detailed fashion; centering around Christys struggle of dealing with the severity of his physical condition while, through the support of his loving & caring family (which included some 22 siblings in all, with thirteen siblings surviving), making himself rather well-known as an outstanding writer, painter & poet. Christy Brown was never regarded as a man trapped inside a prison of a twisted, contorted body, but as a man who could show an entire universe just exactly what he became capable of doing - giving an abundance of love, hope & faith through the genius of his talents. From boyhood (when Christy first snatched a piece of chalk from his sisters hand using his only mobile foot) to manhood (when Christy turned the world on its collective ear by never saying never & refusing to give up in spite of his condition, letting his masterworks speak for themselves), Browns life is a worthwhile journey, & everyone, disabled or not, can profit from his experiences. With so much to offer, its not hard to see why "My Left Foot"s two main actors (Daniel Day-Lewis & Brenda Fricker) received Academy Award nominations for their outstanding work in one of the best movies of 1989. After seeing this film several times now, I often wonder why Hugh OConors performance (as the young Christy) became overlooked, & didnt garner him any major hardware as a result. As a result of Day-Lewis potrayal as the adult Christy, it was quite amusing that many people were convinced that the otherwise healthy actor himself had cerebral palsy. In fact, I believe it was through Day-Lewis commitment & dedication to the role (even refusing to come out of character & eating lunch in a wheelchair) is a major reason why he earned that well-deserved Academy Award. Not at all far behind Day-Lewis & Frickers performances, is the wonderfully touching portrayal by Ray McAnally (who died shortly after filming ended) as Christys tough-as-nails father Paddy Brown. In conclusion, if everyone followed Christy Browns example that he lived by in his forty-nine years spent on earth, the world would be a much better place in which to live. As for the features in this Special Edition DVD release, the reviews are a good read & the interviews are insightful. It would have been a real treat if Daniel Day-Lewis himself had been present in this Special Edition to give his account on Christy Browns life story. Hugh OConors interview sheds at least a little light on Christys beginnings & gives this DVD edition more than enough credibility of making "My Left Foot" worthwhile & necessary for ones DVD movie collection. The video itself, although containing some noticeably visible dirt spots in places, is still a good transfer, & the audio quality is excellent. I cant say enough about this wonderfully brilliant piece of cinema (kudos to Jim Sheridan for his excellent directing & to Shane Connaughton & Sheridan for a well-written screenplay), so just pick up your very own copy of "My Left Foot" & see what all the fuss is about!

' A103KNDW8GN92L	B00005JO0S	November 15, 2005	4	5	4.0	A case study on womens rights	 Women, for the most part, have faced some major problems during the first half of the 20th century (including events that occurred beforehand & certain situations that continue to thrive even in todays world). Some of these problems include suffrage, second-class citizenship & job security - the latter subject being the primary focus of "North Country". The movie deals with a group of working-class women facing an upheaval struggle while working at a Minnesota factory. The discrimination these women encounter is apparent throughout the film, & is captured beautifully & theatrically, leaving no stone unturned. The sexual harassment premise will leave the average viewer on the edge of their seat, leaving one to ponder the fate of these women on the road to nowhere, with a slimmering ray of hope off somewhere in the distance. Featuring outstanding performances from both Charlize Theron (as a lead worker & advocate of conditions in the workplace) & Frances McDormand (as a worker later debilitated as a result of the plants negligence), "North Country" has enough stamina to maintain a continual flow of dramatic nuances to keep one from falling asleep at anytime during the run of the picture. Kudos to Woody Harrelson (as an attorney) for providing one of the films most upstanding displays of character, & a rather moving portrayal at that. Based on actual events, "North Country" could very well be in the running for earning some serious hardware at award ceremonies before 2005 is history. The soundtrack is not to be taken lightly, either - featuring songs by the likes of Bob Dylan (a Minnesota native) & various other musical artists which deserve more than honorable mention raves. This is one movie thats destined to be in ones all-important DVD library, thats for certain!              ',nonspam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B00005JNYP	August 7, 2005	3	7	4.0	T & A The Dukes Way! 	 A motion picture mostly based on the television series, "The Dukes of Hazzard" contains a lot of what fans of the 1979-1985 original series have come to expect: savory redneck characters, all-out dragstrip car chases, sexy, waifish babes decked out in skimpy bikinis, & a whole lot of Southern exposure. The plot & storyline fits neatly into the movies 1 hour & 45 minute time frame, but, if youre tuning in expecting to see your favorite original series stars make a personal appearance or just a mere 2-minute cameo, youll sorely be in for a disappointment. With that qualm aside, lets focus on some of "...Hazzard"s main players. The films two main leads, Seann William Scott & Johnny Knoxville, who play our two heroes Bo & Luke Duke, fit nicely into their roles (including their tight blue jeans!). Scott & Knoxville couldnt have played their roles any better, plus, those Southern accents earn a passable grade of C+ at best. But, I have to admit there were stunt doubles handling the highly skilled, fast-paced driving. A word to the wise, kids; dont try these stunts at home. Jessica Simpson does a marvelous job of portraying the drop-dead-gorgeous Daisy Duke. For a singer, Simpsons acting isnt half-bad, & almost steals the show from the films three main male leads, which brings me to Burt Reynolds role of Boss Hogg. Although hes no Sorrell Booke, Reynolds acting here isnt quite a cut above Bookes portrayal in the TV series, but is sort of unique in its own subtle mannerism-ish way. Whats missing in Burts performance, is the ornery scowl Sorrell Booke brought to the TV screen, including an open-faced meanness that was second-to-none - right up there with ol Ebenezer Scrooge & Sheriff Buford T. Justice (the latter being another Reynolds vehicle & nemesis, but thats sort of another story). Burts quiet performance as Boss Hogg could go as passable at best, although that white suit he was sporting could have contained a couple more pillows at best! The Roscoe character (M.C. Gainey), was waaaay off center, & voiced rather monotone throughout the picture. No hawkey, southern cackle, no expressionism, no nothing. James Bests portrayal of Roscoe P. Coltrane in the series definitely wins hands down versus Gaineys one-dimensional characterization here. Please dont get me started on Enos here. The actor who portrayed him didnt remotely look anything like the Enos character portrayed by Sonny Shroyer in the original series. Lynda Carters cameo was nice to see, albeit a brief one, nonetheless. But, the real star of the film would have to be Willie Nelson. As Uncle Jess, he pretty much has the physical presence & the mannerisms down to a tee. Nelsons performance is almost a dead-ringer for the Denver Pyle character from the series. To sum it all up, "The Dukes of Hazzard" will provide a lot of what the average viewer will pay to see in a motion picture, & will get an adequate amount of peachy-keen Georgia-type Southern exposure in the viewing process. This movie would have gotten a five-star rating easily, if series regulars Tom Wopat, John Schneider, Catherine Bach, James Best & Sonny Shroyer had gotten a place in the movie, even if it had been a mere two minute cameo appearance. Hence, the docking of one star. Still a good movie to waste a typical weekend day in seeing, nonetheless.                 ',nonspam

After viewing "Ferris Buellers Day Off", you may ask yourself "Hmm...just exactly how was a cool, righteous dude such as Ferris Bueller able to pull his antics off, and without getting caught in the process?" Such is a question which may come to mind, regardless of whether youre a teenager, or if youve left your teenage years long behind you.Ferris (Matthew Broderick) is one lucky kid who has it all: a pair of loving and understanding parents (played by Lyman Ward and Cindy Pickett), a beautiful and intelligent girlfriend named Sloane Peterson (played by Mia Sara), and, to top it all off, a bright and successful future ahead of him. But...somethings missing...Although hes already missed nine days this school year, Ferris decides to undertake the most important "Senior Skip Day". In order to pull this feat off, Ferris enlists the help of his best friend Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck), whos home sick in bed. Together, they both cook up a scheme to get Ferriss girlfriend out of a boring history class, with both Ferriss school principal (Jeffrey Jones) and his sister Jeanie (Jennifer Grey) under heavy suspicion - both of whom are determined to catch Ferris with his pants down. While all this is happening, many comical moments occur in the unfolding, including a hilarious classroom scene with Ben Stein (in an early role) as a drone economics teacher (whom I personally would have loved to have had as an instructor during my high school years!), plus various other classic scenes and dialogue worthy of many a viewing.The secondary "star" of "FBDO", is a 1961 Ferrari GT, which gets quite a workout during much of the movie (although this big red machines fate is a bit too much to mention). Its interesting to note that four Ferraris were used in the making of this outstanding motion picture.But, you may also ask yourself: "How was it that Ferris & Co. were able to visit all those landmark places in Chicago all in one day?" And what landmarks these venues are! First, our mischievous gang of merry gentlemen and one debonair lady take in the sights of our nations third largest city high atop the tallest building in the world, the Sears Tower, then its on to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for an instants insight into the traders market, and on to a midday lunch break at a fancy French restaurant, where Ferris barely avoids meeting up with dear old Dad. After their midday respite, Ferris, Cameron and Sloane take in a Cubs game at historic Wrigley Field (before lights were installed for night games, a spectacle which truly made this ballpark a one-of-a-kind attraction, alongside its ivy-covered outfield walls). Finally, our gang pays a visit to the Art Institute of Chicago, where unique and stylistic works of physical, impressionistic structures await our unique band of "tourists".What occurs during and what follows this "field trip" is very pacey and classic comedy dialog, just like the outing around the city (including a must-see free-for-all "concert" and sing-along in one). Just watch Ferriss pursuing principal and his jealous sister TRY and catch him in the act. Youll ABSOLUTELY die laughing!"Ferris Buellers Day Off" is another John Hughes written and directed masterpiece worthy of high praise. The master of teen flicks is clearly at the top of his game here. You DO NOT want to miss the closing credits as well. Just make sure "FBDO" is on your must-see, must-own list of important movie titles to add to your important video collection...and I mean RIGHT NOW!      ',spam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	0800109481	November 9, 2002	11	16	5.0	One of The Brat Packs Best	 "St. Elmos Fire" takes somewhat of a surrealist look into the lives of seven friends post-collegiate experiences. Although the personal and social lives of these seven individuals feature some storybook personas, theres still some very realistic scenes neatly contained within certain happy-go-lucky career-oriented sequences this film conveys, such as the case of Judd Nelsons charaters political aspirations of switching parties from Democratic to Republican, seeing as how it was the 1980s thing to do, but hey, whatever makes him happy. Another such "happy-go-lucky" scenario featured here is Emilio Estevezs characters desire to be that of an "errand boy" type, working for a hot shot businessman while getting his own chauffeur, all the while not having to lift a finger. What makes this scenario more fantasy-based than anything is seeing as how and why a recent college graduate with a law degree would rather opt at being a gopher for some rich guy instead of starting his own law practice, where he could make limitless amounts of money. Beats me. Aside from the fantasy-based scenes, there are plenty of dramatic hooks that make "St. Elmos Fire" worth viewing, such as the different characters dealing with other career decisions and loves lost (and regained). All the main performers acting is top-notch, especially Demi Moores (in an early film role). Moore has a scene where shes featured virtually by herself, which will bring a tear or two to the eye. Andrew McCarthy, Ally Sheedy, Mare Winningham and Rob Lowe deserve many kudos for their fine performances here as well. Since this is a feature which stars much of "The Brat Pack" cast, including the degree of  "teenage-like" angst and socio-political views prominently displayed in the storyline, one would think this is a John Hughes written and directed film, but it isnt. "St. Elmos Fire" (at least) was directed by Joel Schumacher, although Hughesian themes run rampant throughout much of this movie, as mentioned in the prior sentence. Even Molly Ringwald could have had a place all her own here (why she wasnt included in the cast remains a rather profound mystery to me!). All of the scenes, whether realistic or not, were well written and well thought out, which make "St. Elmos Fire" a motion picture worthy of adding to your video library today! Even the soundtrack is an essential must-own as well (featuring cuts from John Parr, David Foster, Jon Anderson and others)!      ',spam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B0000033TE	September 23, 2002	2	2	5.0	This is one show no one can DEFINITELY afford to miss!	 The dynamically musical trio of Keith Emerson, Greg Lake & Carl Palmer have released some spectacularly crafted albums throughout their career ("Tarkus", "Trilogy", "Pictures At An Exhibition", etc.), but none can match the charismatic and artistic prowess of "Brain Salad Surgery". The album kicks off with the anthemic "Jerusalem", with a melody similarly akin to "God Save The Queen" (the British national anthem, for those who dont know). "Toccata" features a barrage of musical variances which range from racey orchestral showings to stomping percussive fireworks (courtesy of Emerson and Palmer), with plenty of artistic hooks to keep even the most casual ELP fan entertained for hours on end. "Still...You Turn Me On" is a lovely "ballad" written by Lake, which contains many wonderful indecisive qualities, as candidly expressed in the lyrics. "Benny The Bouncer" is extremely witty and comical in its own sordid, nonsensical way, and features lyrics by Pete Sinfield. This track is authenticated by Greg Lakes "half-drunken" vocal delivery, which gives it the perfect touch. It awkwardly leads its way into the masterful "Karn Evil #9 Suite", with the high water mark being the "1st Impression Part 2" section (also affectionately known as "Welcome Back, My Friends"). The other highlight of the "KE#9 Suite" is its "2nd Impression", and features yet another unique musical side of this awesome trio (and you thought ELP didnt do jazz, huh?). The entire "Karn Evil #9 Suite" is worth its weight in gold, and is THE main reason for the existence of "Brain Salad Surgery". The interview of the three band members (including Pete Sinfield, whose few lyrical contributions made great noticeable strides here) provides an insightful look into the "surgery" of this edible, tasty "salad", which was prepared with the kind of care that only Emerson, Lake & Palmer are capable of mastering. The plastic hologram cover of this special edition of "BSS" really makes H.R. Gigers cover artwork on the CDs front booklet come to life! So, by all means, come inside, come inside and see the show! ELP has a sight thatll make you drool!      ',nonspam

Although the suites from albums such as "Aqualung" and "A Passion Play" arent present here, theyre really not necessary in this case, since Ian Anderson and crew mustve been worn to a frazzle since creating and producing three previous masterworks ("Aqualung", "Thick As A Brick" and "A Passion Play"). Hence, the band needed a break, so they just broke the concept down to a more simplified approach - writing mostly short and simple songs dealing with war and tyranny ("War Child"), victory ("Queen And Country"), freedom [from strife] ("Skating Away On The Thin Ice Of A New Day"), and just plain celebratory mayhem ("The Third Hoorah"), among other subjects. Ah, but since Jethro Tull was exhausted from completing (really) four "Stand Up" concept albums ("Living In The Past" included), the band felt they could afford to flirt with some nonsensical ideas, as presented in the silly lyrics and the semi-progressive flute and guitar drives featured in the whimsical "Sealion" - perhaps the standout track on "War Child". Even a poppish tune works well here in the sweet cadences of "Bungle In The Jungle", a number which reached the Top 30 in the U.S.. A further note of interest: At one point during the 1974-75 concert tour in support of this album, Ian Anderson would introduce the title of the above latter selection as..."Rumble In The Bathroom"! (I wonder if he had a unique set of lyrics to go with the title change?) Funny stuff! One would call it "potty humor", if you get the joke. Anyway, as was sort-of stated earlier, virtually all the songs fit together to create a story of "biblical" proportions (mini-suites, as is the case here), as Jethro Tull had been known for in prior works. Even though a majority of the tracks on "War Child" contain a slight slant towards commercial pop, it still retains a grand degree of progressive charm, a Tull trademark. "War Child" will grow on you after the first listen, so pick this up only after youve listened to one of Tulls previous excursions ("Aqualung", "Thick As A Brick" or "A Passion Play") if youre one of the Tull uninitiated. Well worth the purchase (trust me)!      ',nonspam

Continuing on in the tried and true ELP fashion, Keith Emerson, Greg Lake & Carl Palmer create a stellar and unique masterpiece that is "Tarkus". The title suite has a lot to offer for the serious progressive-rock die-hard, complete with an Emerson/Palmer synthesizer/keyboard and drum clinic in the middle section [from the d) "Mass" to f) "Battlefield" sections, where both Keith and Carl play off one another beautifully without upstaging one another in the process]. The g) "Aquatarkus" section eases the listener out, courtesy of a Palmer military styled drum coda. "Jeremy Bender" is also done in a similar style of "Benny The Bouncer" (from "Brain Salad Surgery"), except "JB" is more evenly and smoothly constructed, with Lakes velvety vocals sung over the top. "Bitches Crystal" and the first half of "The Only Way (Hymn)" are spiced with some mellow pastoral flavorings, which feature religious lyrics sung by Lake (with the passion of a choirboy!) in both tracks. "Infinite Space" contains yet more down-home ELP jams, with the boys doing their craft, and doing it well. The dominant "now or never"-like tones of "A Time And A Place" are evident in Greg Lakes gruff powerful vocals - sung like a fury of hellfire! "Are You Ready Eddy?" (a "sort-of" ode to Eddy Offord, who engineered this album, and would later produce [and engineer] several albums for Yes as well) shows Emerson, Lake & Palmers willingness to want to just rock out, and in grand 1950s fashion, too, although the Beatles-esque lyrics are a bit on the wild, nonsensical side (although one has to admit it is a bit keenly different!)!!!With a magical display of perks, quirks and a variety of musical styles present on this, ELPs 1971 sophomoric wonderwork, it shows just how far this dynamic trio would and could go to make "that one supersonic opus". Fast forward to "Brain Salad Surgery" - but not before you make "Tarkus" (and dont forget "Trilogy"!) an all-important choice for your CD library!      ',nonspam

After the highly successful "Aqualung", Jethro Tull felt they had something more to prove to themselves and to their fans. The result is this masterwork chock full of ascerbic wit, mayhem and musical introspection - all of which come to the forefront in grand Tull fashion on "Thick As A Brick". Anderson & Co. extended their repertoire from their last effort by displaying a barrage of musical stylings, complete with a plethora of riffy rock, mixed in with a dash of folk and flute introspections masterfully done by Ian Anderson. These ingredients make for a uniformly veritable "passion play", and contain every artistic method kown to mankind, all of which are found in both heavy-duty "Bricks" featured here. A stripped-down live version (performed at New Yorks Madison Square Garden, circa 1978) is also featured here - another extra brick thrown in for good measure. Ah, but the fun doesnt stop there, for, as an extended bonus, theres an interview featuring Anderson, Martin Barre and Jeffrey Hammond revealing all concerning the making of this very special masterpiece, a crowning touch added by the folks at Chrysalis. Please allow a number of listens in order for all the melodrama to sink in. One will discover a whole new set of sounds with each passing listen. Youd have to be mighty "thick"-headed not to include "Thick As A Brick" in your must-have artistic CD collection. Do yourself a favor, and purchase your "Brick" today!      ',spam

"Atom Heart Mother" is truly one masterwork that contains all of the above-mentioned ingredients...INCLUDING the kitchen sink. Although the albums cover features a rather slick bovine sporting its front, "AHM"s three middle cuts features some minor "anal" abrasions, as particularly found in the Richard Wright-penned "Summer 68" and in the Roger Waters composition "If". As far as the latter tune is concerned, it isnt the Dylan-esque folk flavor that gives it such a down-in-the-mouth atmosphere - instead, its the depressing lyrics about Waters dealing with his good friends (Syd Barrett) departure from Pink Floyd, and being unable to fix his troubled mates problems. "Summer 68s" "slow as molasses" fervor is redeemed by its somewhat killer rock edged coda towards the end of this track. "Fat Old Sun" is the least "dense" of the middle three, and contains nice lyrical and guitar work from David Gilmour. "Atom Heart Mother"s bookends make it the ulimate psychedelic ride of a lifetime, as displayed in grand Floydian fashion in the opening "AHM Suite", complete with a barrage of varied musical instrumentation, with horns and orchestration thrown in for good measure (even a horses neigh is buried beneath somewhere!). Since EVERYTHING is found in the "AHM Suite", it means THE KITCHEN SINK is there in the other brilliant bookend "Alans Psychedelic Breakfast"...its LITERALLY there, people, take my word for it! All the sounds and nuances of preparing breakfast will just make your mouth water, so come with a healthy appetite! But, this breakfast isnt complete without a hint of psychedelia as an after meal treat, as Pink Floyd brings epic proportions to the table. Even though "Atom Heart Mother" has just a few weak spots somewhere in the middle, its worth having in ones CD collection for both the suites and that cute cow on the cover. As Roger Waters would later state in a future popular single: "Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash" down to your local retailer today, and make this "cash cow" your pet today, before someone buys up the entire farm!

The year 1971 was one which saw the progressive rock scene begin to come to life, which started to brim with a creative batch of verve and whimsical ideas. Jethro Tull was one such group that could be counted on to deliver the goods, carried out brilliantly both in the musical and lyrical department in linear progressive fashion. Actually, "Aqualung" is a concept album, as noted on the first generation CDs back cover, with the listing being comprised of two mini-suites: "Aqualung" and "My God". Both suites have their artistic moments - with "Aqualungs" high points being well-stated and scoped out with the classic rock radio staples "Cross-Eyed Mary" and the title track, which sees overly-frequent airplay to this day. Other exceptional tracks on the "Aqualung" suite include the vaguely humorous "Cheap Day Return" and the thought-provoking "Wondring Aloud", among others. Other standout gems are featured in the "My God" suite as well, as our hero (Aqualung) is about to meet his fate. Ian Andersons artistic wit and depth is displayed in full-force in this section, as is displayed in yet another classic rock anomaly, "Locomotive Breath". "Hymn 43", "Slipstream" and the closer "Wind-Up" are the ultra-rich fabric that holds the rest of this seamless, yet timeless masterwork together. With such a wondrous array of songs interwoven together in a smooth, concise fashion, combined with a neoclassical album cover, featuring our hero (resembling Christ, perhaps), "Aqualung" is truly a sumptuous feast to the ears, thus belonging in everyones CD collection. Although "Aqualung" is an upstanding Tull masterpiece, Anderson & Co. would take their art-rock musical & lyrical skills to the next level with their next release "Thick As A Brick", as that release would beat out "Aqualung" by just a small margin. But, no Jethro Tull collection is complete without "Aqualung" AND "Thick..." in ones all-important CD library. Grab em both, while theyre still hot!      ',nonspam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000002U82	September 5, 2002	1	1	5.0	This Is THE Album For ALL Generations!	 "Dark Side Of The Moon" - the title says it all, and needs no introduction. Hence, no title name appears on its opaque black, prism dominated cover. If one were to take a copy of this landmark LP (in any of its forms, be it vinyl, CD, 8-track, cassette, etc.) out in the street (presumably of a large urban area) and show it to a random sample of, say, 1,000 people, Id be willing to bet a years salary that at least 750 of those randomly sampled people (3 out of every 4, or 75%), if not more, at least know this album by name, yet countless others know "DSOTM" for its sticker-shock musical and lyrical value, and with good reason. From the introductory heart pulsations of "Speak To Me", all through the hard-heavy footsteps wading their way into "On The Run", going full-steam off the beaten path into the schizoid universe of twisted logical minds that is "Brain Damage", back to those hard-pumping heartbeat rhythms to "Eclipse" this highly-rated, intellectual head-trippy melange of artistic delights. There are lots of delectably tasty hidden treasures neatly tucked away in-between, so its best to listen to "DSOTM" all the way through to achieve maximum musical pleasure. The credit for making "DSOTM" the brainchild it has evolved into over the course of the past 29 1/2 years of this legendary albums existence rightfully goes to Roger Waters, whose varied, texture-laden lyrics and guitar dramatics, including the able assistance of David Gilmour, Nick Mason and Richard Wright, (all of whom) really pushed the musical envelope one note further and higher, thus bringing this project to its artistic knees, as "DSOTM" uses just about every audio-technical device known to man in ANY dimension. If there is even the slightest downside to this unique work of art, it would be the "commercialized" sounds of the albums only Top 40 single, "Money" (although it is a brilliant "ka-chinger", with the cash register sound effects and all), which probes the "dog-eat-dog" society in which we are accustomed to living, which catapults Waters observations, in that society as a whole is "one day closer to death", as probed in "Time". This awakening to the realization of death is cause for "alarm" (as noted in the timepiece sound arrangements carefully augmented with magnificent timing and precision in the CDs middle section), since striving for all the excesses of life is bound to make a majority of the populace insane (except me!), as documented in the closing "Brain Damage/Eclipse". With all the style and substance of musical ambience contained in "DSOTM", its no wonder this album has sold some 30 million copies (and rising) worldwide, making Pink Floyd one of the all-time versital and innovative acts of progressive-rock, and perhaps rock history. Even though Michael Jacksons "Thriller" LP may own the all-time record in terms of sales (in the neighborhood of 50 million units sold and counting), it will never, ever match "DSOTM"s musical and artistic prowess, which is sensational (although "Thriller" works well as an outstanding pop album, nevertheless being somewhat dated). Its no wonder "Dark Side..." haunted the Billboard album charts for fourteen consecutive years, which makes it all the more a very fascinating and special body of work craftfully executed by one of the ambassadors of prog-rock: "The Floyd"! If the above statistical information still doesnt sway you to get off that sofa and make the all-important purchase of an infinite lifetime, well, all I can say is... "Ill see you on the Dark Side Of The Moon"!      ',nonspam

Wettons bass work and Brufords percussion rhythms (especially on "OMRN") are audio poetry in motion as well.

The world would get a healthy dose of ELPs wholesome, technically sound progressive-rock artistries (on this and future ELP efforts), all of which are homogenically and proudly displayed on the opening track, the lone instrumental "The Barbarian". Lakes soaring buzz guitar starts this track off on its merry way, with Emerson and Palmer chiming in with a keyboard and drum clinic soon afterward. The musical tempo then spirals downward just a bit at the beginning of "Take A Pebble", with Lake adding a Crimson-esque touch to his soft, velvet-like vocal delivery. ELP displays an all-out musical assault on the ears on "Knife-Edge", as these three diverse and talented musicians pull out every musical variation neatly housed in their well-tuned arsenal, courtesy of Lakes rhythmic, bottom-heavy bass, Emersons upscale keyboard/piano harmonies and Palmers stormy, cutting-edge style drumming. Much of this same musical craftsmanship is carried over into the "Three Fates: Clotho/Lachesis/Atropos" suite, although both the lyrical and intrumental qualities ELP would present on future suites on following albums would appear to be a tad more developing and insightful ("Karn Evil #9" from the explosive "Brain Salad Surgery" being a prime example). The "Three Fates" suite is still very hook-laden, as it sports many different musical styles, with several artistic hooks to keep even the most die-hard ELP fanatic entertained for hours on end. "Tank" is yet another superb piece of explorative art from the group, and doesnt "tank" in the process. "Emerson Lake & Palmer" ends with the tediously poppy, yet enjoyable, "Lucky Man", ELPs first (and perhaps only) U.S. Top 40 hit single. This track goes off on its own unique veritable artistic tangent (courtesy of Emersons keyboards and Moog synthesizer), which saves it from being a total commercial disaster (which it isnt). Overall, theres much pleasure to be had from ELPs debut, even though this soon-to-be supergroup would dig deeper into their creative progressive portfolio on their next release "Tarkus" and beyond. "Tarkus" would prove to be the effort that put Emerson, Lake and Palmer on the musical map, but, as for the case with their self-titled debut, ELP had to start somewhere, and what a beginning this release truly was, and still is! So, like the eagle on the cover, "fly" on down to your local retailer today, and pick this one up. Definitely worthy of having in your must-own CD collection!      ',nonspam

"Pulp Fiction" is one box office blockbuster that certainly doesnt compromise on principle, as it features four uniquely interwoven,  well-written and well-thought-out storylines, which will leave the average viewer baffled and bewildered by their outcomes. "PF" is unique in its premise, in that this pictures scenes, in a way, were shot backwards, instead of in one continuing sequence, to leave the viewer free to come up with his or her own theory as to how each of these separate plots came to their respective introduction and conclusion. It is also funny and ironic that both opening and closing scenes were shot at the same locale, with the same exact sequence, too, creating a bunch of loose ends left for the viewer to tie together, as noted above, leaving the viewer to use his or her imagination here. Director Quentin Tarantino lets the audience participate in this upstanding masterpiece, and doesnt insult the viewers intelligence in the process, which is only part of the beauty of watching a movie of this caliber. The other part, is watching "PF"s all-star cast add their individual perspectives and talents to each of the characters they portray, with both John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson portraying savvy and suave hit men, Bruce Willis portraying a tough-guy boxer and Ving Rhames playing a near-accomplice whos out to get Willis, among other performers featured here, including a cameo by Tarantino himself. All in all, "Pulp Fiction" is Quentin Tarantinos absolute best directorial study in contrast, and is a real eye-opener, with not one boring moment, whatsoever. The VHS Special Edition also features some added trailer footage at the conclusion of the film, narrated by Tarantino himself - another outstanding reason why "Pulp Fiction" is a must-see, must own motion picture that belongs in every movie buffs video library!

Billy once again proves why hes the quintessential master of the ballad, as is clearly the case with the hit single "Honesty" and on the slow-burned non-single "Until The Night".

Since being in the music business almost 35 years, the dominant force of Genesis has done it all; from writing film scores to creating some of the most spectacular and breathtaking soundscapes in the history of rock music. Banks continues his remarkable musical journey on the 1991 release "Still". In order to create the perfect musical landscape, Tony has a "cast of thousands" performing vocal duties here. Nik Kershaw starts things off with the upstart "Red Day On Blue Street" - which describes the British political scene in fine lyrical form. Kershaw also lends vocals on another track; the upbeat "I Wanna Change The Score", which was co-written by Kershaw with Banks. Also joining Tony on board, is his friend (from Marillion) Fish, who performs on tracks such as the dark & decadent "Angel Face" and on the eventful "Another Murder Of A Day". Jayney Klimek is present on two vocals as well: on the hauntingly quiet "Water Out Of Wine" & on the aerobically upbeat "Back To Back", which has a similar feel to "Queen Of Darkness" - a track which was featured on Banks previous effort, the 1989 release "Bankstatement", also featuring Alistair Gordon on vocals, as well as Klimek. Andy Taylor (no, not the Taylor from Duran Duran), is the featured vocalist on selections such as "The Gift" and on "Still It Takes Me By Surprise". Mr. Banks even gets into the singing act (no surprise), as his vocalization on his lone vocal, titled "Hero For An Hour", is both tolerable and cute on all fronts. This numbers storyline features a fairy tale-like symposium, which is "front page news" in any lyrical buffs "scrapbook" of sorts. Nik Kershaw (see above) contributes the greatest number of vocal tracks here (three), and performs on the CDs closing track as well - the melancholic "The Final Curtain", whose lyrics have an eerie similarity to another Banks composition, "Fading Lights", from the Genesis album "We Cant Dance", released later the same year as "Still" (1991). This would not be the end of Banks career as a solo artist or as a collaborator (he would go on to record two more albums with Genesis) - as on Tonys next "solo" release, titled "Strictly, Inc.", he teams up with Wang Chungs Jack Hues and other noteworthy figures in the world of music. Tony is currently working on two separate musical projects as we speak: ones an album of classical suites, the others a rock album (the working title of this album is "Denied"). Both are scheduled for release some time in 2002. With so much already on Tony Banks musical and artistic plate, it proves one thing: Tony Banks is "Still" the dominant force in music today.

All of the other standout compositions featured here are sure to make one a student of the school of classical art. Roger Williams finest adaptable movie scores make appearances here as well. "The High and the Mighty" stands tall on its own merits, while "Tammy" brings out a feminine side all its own, complete with a smooth orchestral flow, as is the case with the majority of the selections featured on this "Greatest Hits" mini-anthology. But, Williams is not totally content to rest on his serene musical laurels, for on "I Got Rhythm", he really sews his wild musical notes in a progressive-like fashion. Even Roger is apt to turn such classics into a work of art, like the masterful "Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto #1". Heck, even ol "Tchaik" would tip his hat to Mr. Williams piano stylings, thus making the master proud. Theres not one bad composition to be found on "Roger Williams Greatest Hits", although it is most likely one will find more complete Roger Williams anthologies in print. With that said, this greatest hits collection is a must-have item to have in ones classical CD library. Musical genius of this magnitude only comes along once in a lifetime, so its important to make this a wothwhile purchase ASAP, before MCA takes it out of print.      ',nonspam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000002O3S	June 9, 2002	2	2	4.0	The Complete Conlee Anthology	 John Conlee has had a phenomenal career in the world of classic country music, and this collection of John Conlee standouts is an ultimate testament to that outstanding career. Most of the selections featured here display a theme of lost love and sheer romantic bliss - a Conlee trademark. These traits are successfully captured in the signature "Rose Colored Glasses", the amnesiac ambience of "I Dont Remember Loving You", the lowbrow mans anthem "Common Man", and in the roundabout, pent-up heavy "Friday Night Blues", among others. Theres also a fantastic rendition of Ray Charles "Busted", as well. "Old School" will defiitely take one back to their high school reunion, replete with memories of their first love. For lovers of up-tempo numbers, theres one titled "Im Only In It For The Love". This is one CD thats worth many a repeated listen in your CD player, that is...IF ONLY THIS TITLE WAS MADE AVAILABLE ON CD, as other John Conlee so-called "greatest hits" collections arent as complete as "John Conlee 20 Greatest Hits" is. This is one CD that definitely deserves to carry the "Greatest Hits" title, and is a CD that desperately needs to be brought back into print. And so, the question that needs to be raised is: HEY RECORD COMPANIES, ARE YOU LISTENING!?! PLEASE BRING "JOHN CONLEE 20 GREATEST HITS" BACK INTO PRINT, PRONTO!      ',nonspam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000002VND	May 21, 2002	3	3	4.0	Ray Parker, Jr. and his "Raydio"	 "Ray Parker Jr. Greatest Hits" is an outstanding collection, which chronicles the former session musicians career, both as a founding member of Raydio and as a solo artist. As almost all the songs will attest, Ray is more than just "Ghostbusters", which should be pointed out that Ray took a lot of heat with this monster hit, in that its lead guitar riff is somewhat reminiscent of Huey Lewis & The News "I Want A New Drug". These two songs shouldnt be compared to each other at all, for one doesnt really sound like the other when it comes to musical versatility. On to the other stellar compositions as featured in this collection. The upstart "Jack And Jill" is a cute adaptation of the classic nursery rhyme, which features solid instrumentation from the band, not to mention some ultra-sonic keyboard playing and soaring lead guitar majestics, courtesy of Parker. The other "Raydio" hits, "You Cant Change That", "Two Places At The Same Time", "A Woman Needs Love" and "That Old Song" are stand-up compositions as well, and these posess many bittersweet qualities, especially "You Cant Change That" - with its bouncy, frolicky instrumentation and tender, playful lyrics and in "That Old Song", complete with references of yesteryear just brimming with nostalgia. "Two Places At The Same Time" demonstrates Parkers ability to make a ballad into a lyrical piece of art, and he drives the point home with a sensual vocal precision. "A Woman Needs Love" provides an insightul look into the "man vs. woman" crescendo, with a "two can play at this game" mentality. After a successful stint with Raydio, it was now time for Ray to take flight with an equally successful solo career, which got off to a flying start with the smash hit "The Other Woman". This was followed up with more successful singles: "Ghostbusters" (from the blockbuster motion picture, of course), "I Still Cant Get Over Loving You" and the synthesizer-heavy "Jamie", to name others. Smooth instrumental jams are contained in the wonderful "For Those Who Like To Groove", as Ray and Raydio are right on the money with this one. Its unusual that a holiday track would be found in a collection of regular songs, but that is the case with the joyous "Christmas Time Is Here". Almost all the songs in this well-put-together collection of Ray Parker, Jr. favorites are worthy of repeated listens, with the exception of "Jamie", which may be too synthesizer-heavy to suit some people (myself included), although there are certain people who might get some enjoyment from it. Overall, with "Ray Parker Jr. Greatest Hits", the "Raydio" man really did himself and his legions of fans proud, and is thus worthy of being in every music fans CD library, whether they are a fan of contemporary rock or soul.

' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000002PD6	April 30, 2002	1	1	5.0	Live AND Well: What An Interesting Concept!	 Although "Live & Well" is a rather unique and dynamic work of art which contains ten tracks, its actually two sides in one...no, make that two ALBUMS in one, being that the first five selections make up the "Live" part, while the latter half of this disc features studio cuts - the "Well" half. Theres no comparing or contrasting both halves of this CD, as the live material and the studio material compliment each other quite nicely, and without any major flaws, too. The only minor flaw on the studio tracks which feature blues legend Al Kooper on piano, is his playing, although quite masterful, comes across as being barely audible for the most part. Koopers piano digitry is somewhat drowned out by the heavy-bottom bass playing featured here, which is why a remastered version of "Live & Well" is so desperately needed, complete with bonus tracks. As for the upstanding compositions on display here, B.B. King is up to his usual guitar playing virtuosity, especially on the "Live" versions of "Dont Answer The Door" and "Sweet Little Angel". The lone "Live" instrumental, "My Mood", contains lots of soul-searching, power-driven down-to-earth chords. The studio tracks have a lot to offer as well. "The King of the Blues" really "Gets Down To Business", as he provides some down-home primo licks on the effervescent "I Want You So Bad", the utterly demanding "Get Off My Back Woman", as well as on the "run the gamut-like" studio instrumental "Friends". But, it is on "Why I Sing The Blues", where B.B. really cuts to the chase, as he gives his fans a major clue as to why hes in the business of performing in the first place (besides his mastery and his love of his "girl" Lucille). Besides the work of Al Kooper on the studio-based "Well" selections, Hugh McCracken provides some top-notch guitar licks as well. It is due to the musical talents which come to the forefront in grand form on "Live & Well", that makes it a must-have, must own CD, and is one title that every B.B. King fan definitely needs to add to their collection - no ifs, ands or buts about it!!!      ',spam

King demonstrates he can do more than just belt out a blues number with great authority. He also incorporates a jazzy atmosphere into a fair number of the tracks in this upstanding collection of both live and studio cuts (courtesy of B.B.s backing band, who are talented in their own right, "The King of the Blues" included). B.B. really takes the cake (and eats it too!!!), especially in front of a live audience, as evidenced in the live compositions "Sweet Little Angel", "Sweet Sixteen" and "Gamblers Blues". Lucille has a mind of her own, too, for she doesnt take any sass from anybody - B.B. included (just kidding!!!)! "The Bluesmeister" gets all the credit for making Lucille all she has turned out to be, for it takes magical, majestical fingers (such as B.B.s) to really get her jump-started and electrified. All the studio tracks here are priceless gems as well, especially "Paying The Cost To Be The Boss" and "Lucille", as these two musical delights are truly a musicians institution. Although "Back In The Alley" is now out of print, a majority of these numbers can be found on other B.B. King compilation CDs, such as on "Paying The Cost To Be The Boss" and on the currently in print live CD "Live & Well", among others. Hopefully, MCA will give "BITA" the remaster treatment, as they have done with a majority of B.B.s other CD titles, with the exception of "Indianola Mississipi Seeds" and the aforementioned "Live & Well", to which both could definitely use the remaster treatment. If you are lucky enough to get a hold of a copy of "Back In The Alley", you are in for a treat. If you already have it, then you already know what a treasured gem this recording truly is. No B.B. King fan can live without it!      ',spam

Needham spares no expense in maximizing the physical car chase ambience, except, unlike his prior pictures which also feature Burt Reynolds (i.e. the first two "Smokey And The Bandit" movies, "The Cannonball Run" (for the most part) lacks the physicality of the car crashes that were an integral part of the "SATB" flicks. Instead, Needham relies on some dirty-pool interplay between various contestants to add to the cross-country racing element. Theres still plenty of action to be had, however, as Needham does a splendid job in bringing everything together, including the somewhat exhausting job of bringing a unique and well-known array of celebrities. Some of these standout entertainers featured in "The Cannonball Run" include the likes of Dean Martin and fellow "Rat Packer" Sammy Davis, Jr. as well. Jack Elam, Mel Tillis, Terry Bradshaw, Dom DeLuise, Burt Reynolds and even a young, up-and-coming Jackie Chan also come along for the ride in this free-for-all run for some big bucks (and not to mention some FAST women!!!). The race is on from New Jersey to California, as everyone is out to claim the big prize, no matter what the cost. The closing moments, as well as the bloopers featured in the final credits, make "The Cannonball Run" well worth the purchase. So, race on down to your local retailer, and order this souped up vehicle today, or youll be left at the finish line (in last place, with nothing to show for it, of course)!      ',nonspam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B00000DD0M	March 24, 2002	3	4	4.0	Not quite as essential as Vol. 2, but has its moments	 Searching through the rock n roll/pop/Top 40 vaults high and low, Boston-based disc jockey Barry Scott comes up with some hard-to-find mostly 1980s singles gems, although some selections on this introductory volume of "The Lost 45s" series are average compositions at best. The cream of these fourteen songs are "Moonlight Feels Right" (Starbuck), "Loves Grown Deep" (Kenny Nolan), "Modern Day Delilah" (Van Stephenson), "Him" (Rupert Holmes) and "More Than Just The Two Of Us" (Sneaker). But, the most stellar track of all, would have to belong to Tony Carey, with the upstanding mild rocker "A Fine Fine Day", which saw frequent video airplay on MTV during its popularity in "The Big 80s". The former two selections mentioned above are the only seventies tracks featured in this fairly above-average compilation of Top 40 treats, including Tycoons "Such A Woman" (another 70s "classic"). As stated previously, the other half of this disc contains mostly average songs, with the exception of both the gawdy, oversynthesized "The Safety Dance" (Men Without Hats) and "Find Another Fool" (Quarterflash). Steel Breeze frontman Ric Jacobs vocalizes a Rick Springfield-styled performance in the fast-paced "You Dont Want Me Anymore". The other average songs on "The Lost 45s", are flavored with some nice, seasoned meaty, bouncy beats, courtesy of Eric Carmens "I Wanna Hear It From Your Lips" and Balances "Breaking Away", among others. But, like its sister companion (Vol. 2), this first one contains at least one or two poor efforts - those being the overrepetitive, tiresome "My Girl (Gone, Gone, Gone)" (Chilliwack) and the somewhat...annoying "The Safety Dance". Even though Barry tried really hard to come up with some worthwhile selections here, he should be given utmost credit in locating the few non-synthesized 80s hits which were produced during that decade - one that was perhaps one of the worst, along with the 90s, as far as music quality and influences from other earlier more noteworthy artists (ex: Bob Dylan, The Beatles, etc.) are concerned. Barry Scott did manage to redeem himself on Vol. 2 of "The Lost 45s" - a collection which features one third more songs, and more premium selections at that. If there is to be a Vol. 3 in this series, hopefully Mr. Scott will come off the success of Vol. 2 on a positive note, and include some potential hits that narrowly missed the Top 40, such as Mac McAnallys "Minimum Love" (#41, 1983), as well as another forgotten lost gem that made the Top 20, the Greg Guidry hit "Goin Down" (#17, 1982). Until Vol. 3 is released, plenty of mileage will have to be had out of Vols. 1 and 2, although it is highly recommended to make "Vol. 2" of this essential series your first purchase before shelling out more money for mostly mediocre songs, although it is worth it for the price of the handful of delights featured in this introductory disc. Keep these lost treasures coming Barry, and whatever you do, please dont stop!      ',nonspam

A manic dialogue, combined with an irregular dose of hilarity performed in Bill Cosby fashion, makes for an interesting stand-up performance in this 1981 "concert" taped in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Bill lets loose a tongue galloping marathon bonanza, as he pulls no punches in describing such subject matter as dysfunctional families, independent toddlers, hillbilly rednecks, dentists, and many more. Expectant mothers and fathers-to-be are sure to get a hoot out of natural child birthing, which is explained in a way only Mr. Cosby can, bringing hilarious results, no doubt. Also, for educational purposes, theres "Say No To Drugs The Cosby Way" - hell show you how to say no, all right!!! Bill also receives some good tips from his own children about what to eat for breakfast (this you gotta hear!), and the results may surprise you! As a result, Mr. Cosby hasnt lost his comedic touch, which means that "Bill Cosby, Himself" may be Bills best stand-up work since his "Bill Cosby Is A Very Funny Fellow - RIGHT!" album (which features the equally hilarious, classic "Noah" skits). "Bill Cosby, Himself" definitely belongs in everyones comedy library. A 1,000,001 laughs will be had by all who view it!      ',spam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	630537189X	March 22, 2002	1	1	5.0	The Ultimate Jamaican Cult Classic!	 If theres one film that captures the pictorial, social and cultural essence of Jamaica and its people in one setting, then "The Harder They Come" is perhaps the ticket. Jimmy Cliff stars as a struggling musician, who goes from odd job to odd job on his way to the top in this 1972 cult classic. Aside from working his way up the nightclub circuit ladder, Ivan (Cliff) finds himself running afoul of the law in the process, an element which makes for an interesting storyline. The thick Jamaican accents make the films storyline hard to follow in spots, although the lush Jamaican environs more than make up for the wonderfully garbled vocalization. Also, some of the "Americanizations" displayed in "The Harder They Come" provide an interesting backdrop for the hilly Jamaican terrain, such as the Shell gasoline billboard sign and Teem (remember that one?) and Pepsi-Cola beverages. It is these American items that add somewhat of a decorative touch to this insightful motion picture. Add to the cast of mostly unknowns (besides Jimmy Cliff), is the veteran Jamaican actor Winston Stona, whose appearance here is more of a cameo, playing a role as a detective. According to various (internet) sources, Stonas next major movie appearance wouldnt come until twenty years later, in a more major role in "Cool Runnings" (filmed in Jamaica as well). "The Harder They Come" would make Jimmy Cliff a household name in the annals of reggae music, alongside another reggae legend, the incomparable Bob Marley. Cliffs music, as featured in "THTC", carries with it such adaptive, effective lyrics and harmonies, both nicely illustrated in the title track and in "You Can Get It If You Really Want" - a selection which sums up Ivans grit and determination in his desire to become a mega-superstar, proving that setting goals and striving to maintain them are what really count in life, if one is willing to persevere through difficult hardships. Although "The Harder They Come" is one stellar film thats definitely not to be missed, a perfect companion would be to add the soundtrack to this all-important purchase. But, it would be wise to purchase "THTC" today, as it is fast becoming one motion picture that will soon be hard to come by. These two above-mentioned items are the perfect compliment with a case of Red Stripe beer and some jerk chicken, so dont miss all the fun and excitement, or youll be making one big "Jamaica Mistaica"!

' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000000D44	March 18, 2002	1	2	4.0	"Classic Hits" from Ankas 1973-1977 period	 Paul Anka has had a phenomenal career, both as a singer/composer and as a sometime actor during his five plus decades in the entertainment industry. "Classic Hits" contains a sampling of this talented performers remarkable career, with a majority of these classics recorded during his 1973-1977 tenure with United Artists. Four of the hits contained in this collection feature duets with Odia Coates, including the gospel-like "I Dont Like To Sleep Alone", as well as their number one smash "(Youre) Having My Baby" and the smooth "One Man Woman/One Woman Man". "(I Believe) Theres Nothing Stronger Than Our Love", another major hit for both Anka and Coates, is included here as well, as is one of Pauls most memorable and beloved hits, complete with a Frank Sinatra-like vocal performance with "Times Of Your Life". "My Best Friends Wife", although somewhat overrepetitive, is still an enjoyable tune, nevertheless. "Anytime (Ill Be There)" has its melancholy moments, but fits in here with ease. Three "newer" renditions of familiar Anka classics are included here too - "My Way", which has been recorded by dozens of artists, including Sinatra and Elvis Presley. This version is brilliantly played out in grand Paul Anka fashion. The peppy "A Steel Guitar And A Glass Of Wine" and the downtrodden "Let Me Try Again" complete this stellar sample collection, courtesy of an international superstar that is Paul Anka. But, since "Classic Hits" is geared more toward the casual Anka fan, the Anka afficianado will find "30 Years Of Hits" more to their liking, as that compilation contains twice as many songs covering Ankas earlier (and later) period(s). "Classic Hits" is still an essential collection all the while, and thus belongs in any music fans CD library. Make sure its included in your purchases today, before it becomes a lost treasure!

' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000002WTE	March 15, 2002	10	11	4.0	The Definitive Jerry Reed Collection, albeit a few omissions	 Of all the words in the English language which can be used to sum up Jerry Reeds remarkable career, both as a musician and as an actor, perhaps these four words can best apply: "Been there, done that". These four words are most apropos, due to Jerrys longevity in the entertainment industry, which spans upwards of almost five decades. It is because of the many different musical styles displayed on "The Essential Jerry Reed" (ranging from country to swamp rock), why Mr. Reed has paved the way for many a future artist, including the likes of Creedence Clearwater Revival, Lynyrd Skynyrd, The Allman Brothers, Charlie Daniels, etc. - each a successful artist/group in their own right. Therefore, Jerry is credited with starting the swamp rock/southern rock genre, and some of the songs featured in this collection ("Amos Moses", "When Youre Hot, Youre Hot", "The Uptown Poker Club" and "Ko-Ko Joe") contain a healthy dose of this well-crafted style of music. The lyrical homespun humor Jerry brings to many of the songs in this rather "definitive" collection adds profound depth to the music, as is the case in such numbers as "The Uptown Poker Club" and in "She Got The Goldmine (I Got The Shaft)", where the latter selection finds Jerry once again in hot water with the same judge in a kangaroo court of law filled with mayhem and hijinks, a recipe which is also the order of the day in the up-tempo "When Youre Hot, Youre Hot" (poor, poor Jerry!). Jerry Reed shows that hes quite the balladeer, as he croons with an unmistakeable vocal depth and precision, found in such tender moments that are nicely supplied in the compromising "A Thing Called Love", "A Good Womans Love" and in "Smell The Flowers" as well. The latter title pretty much sums up Jerrys philsophy in life - in just taking things as they come, letting the chips fall where they may, complete with a touch of "happy-go-luckiness" present in a majority of the songs in this "almost" well put together collection of Jerrys credible compositions. However, "The Essential Jerry Reed" contains some major-minor flaws, none of which are contained in the movie music selections found in the first two "Smokey And The Bandit" pictures ("East Bound And Down" [from "SATB"] and "Texas Bound And Flyin" [from "SATB 2"] - both of which are marvellous and are fine, upstanding numbers, no doubt). One big mistake RCA made in preparing this compilation, was omitting "Smokies" other songs, such as both "The Legend" and "The Bandit", also performed amicably by the talented Jerry Reed. Some other important cuts RCA left behind, are the untamed "Alabama Wild Man" and "U.S. Male". It is due to these aforementioned omissions the reason why "The Essential Jerry Reed" gets only a four-star rating. But, nevertheless, it is a worthwhile body of "The Alabama Wild Man"s guitar pickin delights, and is thus worthy of being in any music collectors CD library. So, it all adds up to more of an "essential", rather than a "definitive" purchase!      ',nonspam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B00005NWMI	March 6, 2002	3	4	4.0	The crowning jewel of Livvys career!	 "Magic: The Very Best Of Olivia Newton-John" contains ON-Js most cherished singles and duets throughout her three decades in the music business. Nearly all of the CDs singles are listed in chronological order, thus taking the listener on an insightful and enjoyable journey through the varous phases of this remarkably talented Australian songstresss career. For starters, the listener is treated to the country phase of Olivias down-home nuances and charm, as displayed in the hits "Let Me Be There" and "If You Love Me (Let Me Know)". Then, Livvy had her first "real pure" adult-contemporary/pop smash "I Honestly Love You" (with the former being released in late 1973 and the latter two released in 1974, respectively.) By 1975, it seemed Olivia felt right at home in the country music spectre, as she released the all-around musical/lyrical ode to countrified "Love Me Or Leave Me" tendencies, as found in the heart-breaky "Please Mr. Please". 1975 was a high point in Olivias career, and was also a year in which she achieved her first number one single on the Billboard pop music charts with "Have You Never Been Mellow", released in March of that same year. In 1976, Ms. Newton-John had one of her last country flavored hits with the Bee Gees penned "Come On Over", before venturing into full-flowing AC/pop waters with the moderate hit "Sam" in 1977. The hits Olivia charted during this 1977-1980 period are lush, dreamy and satisfying compositions, and it is the orchestral arrangements present in these works that make them stand on their own merits. Such is the case in songs as the powerful, soul grabbing (non-orchestral) numbers "A Little More Love", "Deeper In The Night" and "Magic" (with both former tunes charting in 1979 and the latter selection in 1980), also including the duet with international superstar Cliff Richard on "Suddenly", another 1980 release. Olivias collaboration with Electric Light Orchestra electrifies with an intensive wall of sound in the uplifting "Xanadu". Now, its on to the final phase of Olivias career, as far as this very best of compilation is concerned. From 1981 to 1984, Olivia shows off her wild side with reckless abandon, and these qualities really show through in the tracks "Physical" and "Make A Move On Me". Even though the overly-synthesized "Heart Attack" and "Twist Of Fate" are both quite possibly the least appealing tracks in this stellar collection, they still retain a bit of that ol ON-J charisma, nonetheless. Theres no doubt they had to be included here, although it is somewhat of a letdown the record company did not include Olivias first single, the Bob Dylan penned "If Not For You", as well as another duet with John Travolta titled "Take A Chance" (from the motion picture "Two Of A Kind") and also the moderate 1985 hit "Soul Kiss" (which contains backing vocals from "Married With Children" star Katey Sagal). It is because of the above stated omissions why this CD gets docked a half star, but it pretty much sums up the storybook career of one of the best loved and most respected figures in the history of the rock era. Lovers of the movie "Grease" will definitely get long mileage out of Livvys duets w/John Travolta titled "Youre The One That I Want" and "Summer Nights", including "The Grease Megamix" and "Hopelessly Devoted". Despite the major omissions of some of the noteworthy songs mentioned earlier, doesnt mean the entertainment value of "Magic: The Very Best Of Olivia Newton-John" is all but lost, which it isnt. This is still a fun and enjoyful CD to listen to all the while, and is a must for the serious ON-J fan to have in their collection. For the more casual Olivia fan, theres the "20th Century Masters Millennium Edition" CD, even though there is more listening pleasure to be had on "Magic...", since there are twice as many songs as on the "20th Century Masters" ON-J CD, and for only a few dollars more at that, which makes "Magic..." a real steal of a deal! Get it soon, before it goes POOF! OVERALL RATING: 4 1/2 STARS (due to omissions).      ',nonspam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000002TV6	February 12, 2002	2	2	5.0	A Debut Full Of "Funk", Spunk & Fire!	 Grand Funk Railroad burst onto the music scene with their debut 1969 release "On Time". Mark Farner, Don Brewer and Mel Schacher really turned a lot of heads, including those of the naysayers, who doubted "The Funk"s abilty to deliver the goods musically. Mark, Don & Mel each contribute equally here, and dont miss a beat throughout the entire album. Perhaps Mark Farner was speaking on behalf of the youth of the late 60s/early 70s, with his display of angst and budding rebellion present in many of the selections featured on "On Time". For instance, Farner offers a display of defiance in the standoffish "Call Yourself A Man", as noted in the lyrics: "Im not looking for somebody to defend my case. Ive been scorned by more than one, so stop this paper chase." This kind of (pent-up) angst is also felt in Farners guitar playing, as is the case in many of the selections here as well. Don Brewers drumming is in fine, upstanding form, too. One listen to his drum solo in "T.N.U.C." will confirm that fact. The guys mix a little rhythm and blues into their "heavy-metal" odyssies as well, as in such standouts including "Time Machine" and "Heartbreaker". Theres a bit of a passage of "Row, Row, Row Your Boat" featured in the closer "Ups And Downs", which is somewhat of a minor embarrassment, but is workable, nonetheless. All of the selections here are "timeless", and thus, speak volumes of "Grand (Funk Railroad)" proportions. Grand Funk Railroad would continue down this musical path over the course of the next few albums, until "Were An American Band" came out in 1973. It was also by this time that the group dropped "Railroad" from their name and became "Grand Funk". Mark, Don & Mel also added a fourth member to their lineup by this same later time period as well - keyboardist Craig Frost. With this addition, "The Funk" began losing its hard-edged sound, and adopted a bluesier, more radio-friendly aura, thus going commercial. This change may have alienated some of GFRs longtime fans, but on "On Time", this band showed their hard-core fans that they do what they do best - delivering a unique brand of in-your-face, Midwestern-styled rock n roll, a path other Midwestern acts would soon follow, with the likes of such bands as Head East, Styx and REO Speedwagon, to name a few. Grand Funk Railroad was also the first "heavy-metal" band, although their early musical stylings are considered tame by todays standards. "On Time" definitely has a lot to offer for any serious hard rock fan, and is perhaps the best of GFRs early catalog, bar none. But, be warned - "On Time" is not recommeneded for those with weak hearts, or for the high falootin crowd, for that matter. So, by all means, be at your local music retailer "On Time", or else theyll be fresh out of copies. Then where will you be?      ',spam

All of the groups hits featured in this collection cover the bands most productive period between 1969 and 1975. The first half of the disc has songs from Grand Funks "heavy metal" period, such as the charming "Time Machine", the bluesy "Mean Mistreater" and the upbeat remake of Traffics "Feelin Alright". Theres even the butchered single edit version of "Closer To Home", which is regarded as one of their best songs by many (the full-length album version, that is). The second half of this disc features tracks from Grand Funks commercial period, including their raucous rock anthem "Were An American Band" and the infectious "Bad Time", among others. Although this CD contains a sampling of some of GFRs better known classics, it is most likely not recommended for the die-hard Funk fan. Completists of this group will find "Collectors Series" or even the double-CD "Thirty Years Of Funk" more to their liking, since these two anthologies contain more songs. On a slightly smaller scale, "The Best Of Grand Funk" is highly recommended for more casual fans of this legendary bands music.

A few years after Gerry Rafferty scored two major and minor hits with "Stuck In The Middle With You" (1973) and "Star" (1974), as one-half of the Scottish musical duo Stealers Wheel, with Joe Egan, Rafferty went on to a moderately successful solo career overall (although he cut an inauspicious [solo] album prior to co-forming SW, the 1971 release "Can I Have My Money Back"). Most of his stateside successes came in the early part of his career, between 1977 and 1980. Gerrys biggest selling album of his career, the 1978 release "City To City", has a good representation amongst all the selections featured on "Right Down The Line: The Best Of Gerry Rafferty". Sax impresario Raphael Ravenscroft delivers a powerful solo on "Baker Street", which is the key ingredient that makes this selection really stand up and take notice. The other "City To City" hit singles - the major single "Right Down The Line" and the minor hit "Whatevers Written In Your Heart" are also worthy of praise, with the blues-like hooks of "RDTL" and the gospel embracings of "WWIYH". But, the marvelously composed standout tracks dont stop there, as "Right Down The Line..." also contains some up-tempo goodies as well - "Sleepwalking", which has some heart pulsating rhythms, although the lyrics are somewhat on the cheesy side, with both "Shipyard Town" and "A Dangerous Age" being somewhat authenticated with a Scottish/Keltic musical influence. Raphael Ravenscroft also appears on another track, "Bring It All Home", which has a bit of a barroom blues feel to it, with that sassy saxophone interspersed throughout. Theres a nice, introspective soul-searching composition that appears on this best of compilation as well, titled "The Right Moment" - possibly the most overlooked hidden gem on this collection, and has a nice, melancholy ring to it, in both musical and lyrical areas. "The Garden Of England" has its strange and bewildering moments, but fits in here somehow, nevertheless. All in all, theres not one bad song on here, but there could have been some improvements, such as the record company could and should have included Raffertys more noteworthy hits "Home And Dry" (also from "City To City") and "Days Gone Down", which would have solidified a five-star review. "Right Down The Line: The Best Of Gerry Rafferty" is still an outstanding body of compositional works, and thus belongs in every serious fans CD library, Gerry Rafferty fan or not.      ',nonspam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B00004SGN2	February 5, 2002	1	1	4.0	A superb collection of songs thought to be lost forever	 Disc Jockey Barry Scott brings together a collection of lost gems many believe they would never hear (from) again. For the record, almost all of the artists featured in this collection are one and two-hit wonders, with the exception of Del Shannon, who does a splendid job in remaking the Phil Phillips classic "Sea Of Love" (which was also covered later by The Honeydrippers), as well as Phil Seymour, whose one hit here, "Precious To Me", was produced by the well-known Richard Podolor, who also contributed to the production of another one-hit wonder (of sorts) - Rubicon (I say "of sorts", because Del Shannon, Jerry Martini and Phil Seymour each had major and/or minor successes with prior hits - either with a different group or solo [see above and below scenarios]). Their lone hit single, titled "Im Gonna Take Care Of Everything", is also one of the stellar hits included here, which peaked at #28 on the Billboard Top 40 chart in 1978. Rubicon was a San Francisco area group fronted by saxophonist Jerry Martini, who was a member of Sly & the Family Stone a decade before "Im Gonna Take Care..." was released. Another member of Rubicon, Jack Blades, moved on to bigger and better things as a member of the 80s group Night Ranger ("Sister Christian", "When You Close Your Eyes", among other hits). Richard Podolors early production credits include Steppenwolf and Three Dog Night, whom Podolor successfully molded into two powerhouse hit making machines in the late 60s and early 70s. Speaking of moving on...No, on second thought, lets revert back to Phil Seymour, who previously was a member of The Dwight Twilley Band, who had a big hit with 1975s "Im On Fire". Sadly, Seymour died of cancer back in 1993. He left behind some "Precious (To Me)" musical treasures for his many fans to cherish. Now, on to the songs that shouldve been HUGE hits. "If The Love Fits, Wear It" (Leslie Pearl) and "If You Remember Me" (Chris Thompson & Night) couldve been even bigger hits if they were given the right marketing push by the record company brass, but they werent, so the record execs felt they had bigger fish to fry and these one-hit artists were virtually ignored and were never heard from again, which is a shame. If there ever was an award given for "Most Unique Name for a Rock Group", that honor would have to go to The Road Apples, who offer the Dr. Hook influenced "Lets Live Together". But, there cant be a collection of 70s songs without at least one disco number - that being the somewhat infectious "Wham Bam (Shang-A-Lang)" by Silver. For those who cant get enough of those heartwarming, melancholy ballads, youre sure to like Larry Santos "We Cant Hide It Anymore". "The Lost 45s Vol. 2" contains at least one weak entry - Mac Daviss "Rock And Roll (I Gave You The Best Years Of My Life)" and two so-so tunes "Ariel" (Dean Friedman) and "I Couldnt Say No" (Robert Ellis Orrall w/Carlene Carter). The George Baker Selections hip remake of "Paloma Blanca" was previously covered by Slim Whitman (and perhaps others), and this remake is a perfect accompaniment to a majority of the other songs featured in this stellar collection of lost rarities. Quite possibly, the most overlooked "lost" track would have to be the rockin "Sausalito Summernight" (Diesel) - the perfect number for cruisin the interstate. Yes, this collection may contain an overabundance of "cheese", but its the best kind of cheese - the gourmet variety. More of it please, Barry!      ',nonspam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000002PEA	January 31, 2002	5	6	4.0	Edible "Seeds"	 Although not quite as strong and cohesive as B.B. Kings previous release "Completely Well", "Indianola Mississippi Seeds" contains some sweetly scintillating, chills up and down your spine musical vibes. These bluesy, rhythmic pulsations are supplied by a bevy of young, then unknown up and coming musicians, featuring the likes of Joe Walsh (rhythm guitar), Carole King (piano/electric piano) and Leon Russell (piano/electric piano). Together, along with "The King Of The Blues" himself, these four individuals (B.B. included) really put their own unique brand of polish to the tracks featured on "IMS", such as "Youre Still My Woman", "Dont Ask Me No Questions", "Until Im Dead And Cold", "Go Underground", and lets not forget the Russell-penned "Hummingbird", where Leon gives his all both musically and lyrically here. "Kings Special", the CDs lone instrumental, is indeed special. It is on this track where "Lucille" gets wonderfully downright sassy, and she pulls no punches in the process! The main thing about these "Seeds", is not only are they edible, they also contain an extra amount of sweetness, and will make any set of taste buds come to life! With that ultra-hip, snazzy CD cover (featuring a watermelon carved in the shape of a guitar), including the noteworthy musical selections featured on this disc, one would think MCA would give "IMS" the remaster treatment, to which it rightfully deserves (and thus is long overdue), complete with the original album cover artwork, including liner notes and a lyric sheet. One major drawback to various parts of the instrumentation, as featured on this "Compact Disc-Compact Price" version of "IMS", is that Joe Walshs rhythm guitar, Leon Russells and Carole Kings piano/keyboard playing comes across as sounding barely audible in spots. Hopefully MCA will adress this issue if they decide to remaster "IMS". These pre-mastered seeds are still quite tasty, nonetheless, and will leave you craving all the moreso. So please, by all means, eat to your hearts content! After all, B.B. wouldnt have it any other way for his devoted fans (even though I consider myself to be more of a casual fan, but a lover of B.B. Kings music, nonetheless).      ',nonspam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000003S11	January 19, 2002	2	7	5.0	Sounds Good...No, GREAT To Me, Bill!	 Although "Feels Good To Me" is basically a Bill Bruford solo album, as the name on the CD cover signifies, "FGTM" contains a more than able supporting cast, which features superb, top-notch guitar and bass playing, courtesy of Allan Holdsworth and Jeff Berlin. Four of the ten tracks on this CD are vocals, and are supplied nicely by Annette Peacock, who sounds like a merger between Suzanne Vega and Annie Lennox, particularly on the track "Back To The Beginning". The lyrics of this selection could be easily adaptive to a sci-fi film score! The music of "BTTB" is very similar to that of a particular track on the post-Bruford Yes album "Tormato", titled "Release, Release". Speaking of Annie Lennox, Dave Stewart makes a pre-Eurythmics appearance on "Feels Good To Me". Stewarts piano/keyboard electricities sometimes come across as barely audible here, thus being overshadowed by Holdsworths and Berlins decibel overtones on some tracks. Stewart does get a chance to shine, particularly on the instrumentals "Either End Of August", "Springtime In Siberia" (where Stewart really cooks with a wonderfully displayed solo), "If You Cant Stand The Heat..." and the title track - complete with a middle rambling keyboard effect. Rounding out the guest musical lineup, is Kenny Wheeler on fluegelhorn, who, at times, sounds like Kenny G, although Wheeler is not playing the saxophone here, though it sounds as if he very well could be! The delightful talents of Mr. Bruford shouldnt be left out. After all, this is a Bill Bruford CD, and a gorgeously crafted work of musical art it is! Brufords drumming is in a class all by itself, and is comparable to another excellent prog drummer - Phil Collins, both of whom are of equal caliber in the school of percussive art. The musical styles fatured on "FGTM" are somewhat of a cross between Brufords former bands Yes and King Crimson, although for those who are unfamiliar with Brufords musical style, may find "FGTM" a bit hard to take. Perhaps they should listen to Brufords Yes and King Crimson works before delving into his solo material. "Feels Good To Me" is a solid CD on all artistic fronts, and is definitely not for the faint at heart. A must-have for Bruford, Crimson and Yes fans alike.      ',spam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000000HRP	January 18, 2002	7	9	5.0	A First-Rate, First Effort For Brand X	 Brand X truly marked the spot on "Unorthodox Behaviour", their first album. This group showed they could meld their unique style of intricate jazz with an over the top, baroquesque flavor of progressive rock, which, when these two genres meet head on, make for an interesting listen. After having already spent a few years with Genesis, Phil Collins most likely felt his drumming style within that particular group was lacking the type of creativity he demanded (although you have to admit his drumming on the Gabriel-era Genesis albums is nothing short of spectacular, either). With Brand X, he could now show off his creativity in a unique style all his own, and it definitely shows in Collins first outing with the band. His fast-paced drum rolls, present in such tracks as "Nuclear Burn" and "Smacks Of Euphoric Hysteria" are a real treat to the ears (ear candy, if you will), and shouldnt be taken at "face value", if youll pardon the expression. "Born Ugly" is anything but (ugly), and has a rather charming and mysterious quality to it, nonetheless. Percy Joness bass playing is also mind-blowing. One listen to the CDs title track, and youll see (and hear) what I mean. The title track features a unique and different side to Brand X, in that they can really funk out with great timing and precision. Whats more, guitarist John Goodsall brings some of his Average White Band influences to "Unorthodox Behaviour" as well, which adds yet another multi-dimensional side to this band. This AWB-influenced sound can be found in a fair number of the tracks here, including "Nuclear Burn" and "Born Ugly". Robin Lumleys keyboard and piano playing carries with it such depth and magical stardust wizardry, and is the perfect crowning touch to Collins, Goodsalls and Joness "unorthodox" jams - the cherry on top of the tasty, proverbial sundae, if you will. Phil Collins exquisite drumming intricacies, as featured on "UB", can also be felt on his next two releases with Genesis: "A Trick Of The Tail" and "Wind And Wuthering" - moreso on the former than the latter (although "UB" came out immediately after "ATTOT", but "UB" was recorded just before "...Trick...", as the dates in both the "UB" and (UK edition) "ATTOT" CD booklets will attest to that fact). Brand Xs next effort, "Moroccan Roll", would prove to be a weaker effort compared to "Unorthodox Behaviour", most likely as a result of the bands "incoherent noodling" on that particular release. As far as "UB" is concerned, not only does "X" unanimously mark the spot, but is guaranteed to come out in the wash stain-free as well, even after repeated spins!      ',spam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000002PBL	January 1, 2002	1	2	5.0	"Hard Promises" is REALLY "Something Big!"	 On this album, Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers really come into their own, thus coming up with a variety of unique musical styles and arrangements. This is evidenced in a majority of the selections featured on "Hard Promises". The album starts off with a rockin flurry, courtesy of the first three numbers ("The Waiting", "A Woman In Love (Its Not Me)" and "Nightwatchman"), then mellows out with a soothing cool down, as noted in the tracks "Something Big", "Letting You Go" and "Insider". The CD almost ends just as it began, with the driven-homeness of "The Criminal Kind" and "You Can Still Change Your Mind". Even though Petty and the Breakers left a little of their Byrds and Dylan influences behind on "Hard Promises", this is still an outstanding effort, for the most part. Petty & crew really proved to the world they could stand on their own ten legs (even with a little help from Stevie Nicks, who provides backing vocals on "Insider" and "A Thing About You". Petty later returned the favor on Nicks "Bella Donna" album, released later the same year "Hard Promises" came out [1981]), and it shows in the bands musicianship, as featured on this CD. Bob Dylan would be impressed with Tom Pettys awesome sound-alike vocalization on "The Criminal Kind". One of your first New Years resolutions should be including this priceless musical gem in your CD collection. This should be one "Promise" that isnt "Hard" to keep, and thus, is one "Easy" sell!

After putting out their first two efforts, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers really deliver the goods with the 1979 release "Damn The Torpedoes". This is one of Petty & Co.s most successful recordings to date, alongside such gems as "Hard Promises" and "Full Moon Fever" (among others), and it contains two major hits in "Refugee" and "Dont Do Me Like That", including two moderately minor hits with "Even The Losers" and "Here Comes My Girl". What gives "...Torpedoes" such a unique musical flavor, are the creative musical intros displayed in "Shadow Of A Doubt (Complex Kid)", "Century City" and in "Louisiana Rain", where Petty, Benmont Tench, Mike Campbell, Ron Blair and Stan Lynch have these particular musical stylings down to a science. Petty and the Breakers take full advantage of their Byrds and Dylan-esque influenced sounds on many of the tracks here, as found in "Even The Losers" and in some others on this CD. In evidence of Pettys unique musical/lyrical landscapes, theres the rockabilly-like "What Are You Doin In My Life", which features a bit of that Dylan angst, mainly in the lyrics dept.. Petty and the Heartbreakers would continue to experiment with different musical styles in future efforts, thus forever leaving an indelible stamp on the rock era in fine form. "Damn The Torpedoes" is the album that cemented Pettys status as a world renowned, bona fide rock n roll star. Any fan of straightforward, hard-line rock n roll can justify space in their CD library by adding "DTP" to their must-have CD library today!                                          As far as the sound quality of MCAs "Compact Disc-Compact Price" version of "DTP" is concerned, it is probably no worse than the recently remastered version. I happened to pick up one of the last copies of the pre-mastered 1987 CD version while shopping at Circuit City last week. The "CD-CP" discs are generically packaged and have the color/line grid on the back of these CDs. Ive amassed several copies of these discs over the years, and they occupy a good portion of my CD collection. Even though MCA for the most part no longer produces this series, Im sure most people will find the remaster versions equally to their liking ("Damn The Torpedoes" included). The only negative aspect concerning the "CD-CP" series discs, is that they do not contain any original artwork, lyrics or liner notes. These unique discs make wonderful collectors items, so make sure to add them to your collection today, before there are none left!      ',spam

"Pretzel Logic", Steely Dans third album, contains yet more well-styled musical variances, most of which are neatly homogenized in a nice package. These unique stylings are well represented in the opening piano/bass scat-like riff of "Rikki Dont Lose That Number", the folky "Any Major Dude Will Tell You", including the country atmosphere of the breezy "With A Gun", among others. The cool, mellow voice-box guitar effect present in the co-Duke Ellington penned instrumental "East St. Louis Toodle-Oo" is sure to please even the most savvy Steely Dan fan, while "Parkers Band" is rather quick and catchy, so dont blink, or youll miss it! The bluesy selections are worth a few listens as well, such as the title track, with its double-repetetive jazz-influenced verses. If there is a such thing as a "consolation" (mediocre) track on "Pretzel Logic", that honor would most likely go to the flighty "Night By Night", but it qualifies as an erstwhile composition, nonetheless. Since many of the compositions featured on "Pretzel Logic" are somewhat short time-wise, this is one CD where Donald Fagen and Walter Becker and crew really go out of their way to create a really one-of-a-kind scenic musical and lyrical landscape, which is simply nothing short of fantabulous, as well as in the area of musical talent, of which "The Dan" are well adept at!

On "Countdown To Ecstasy", Steely Dans sophomoric effort, Donald Fagen and Walter Becker delve even deeper into their first-rate jazz-oriented flavorings, which are uniquely combined with "The Dans" one-of-a-kind rock n roll stylings. These two genres provide an interesting backdrop in the opening track "Bodhisattva", which jump-starts this CD in fine Steely Dan fashion. "Razor Boy", "Pearl Of The Quarter" and "King Of The World" each have their moments, but the selections that really make "...Ecstasy" worth the purchase, are the smooth, ultra-hip hepcat tones of "The Boston Rag", the magical ambience of "Your Gold Teeth" and the festive "My Old School", as well as the power-driven "Bodhisattva". This is also the album where Fagen, Becker and the gang really get their creative teeth into their playing, getting their brand of jazz oriented rock down to a tee. No one can truly call themselves a true Steely Dan fan until they make "Countdown To Ecstasy" a part of their must have, must own CD collection. With this recently remastered version, no fan of "The Dan" can really go wrong. The groups follow-up title, "Pretzel Logic", is the perfect companion CD, so it would be wise to purchase both items simultaneously. One will find a virtual (digitally remastered) gold mine just waiting to be rediscovered!      ',spam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000002PBH	November 17, 2001	3	3	5.0	Best "Old-School" Buffett	 On "Living & Dying In 3/4 Time", Jimmy Buffetts fourth LP overall and his second release on the now defunct ABC/Dunhill label, it would appear that Buffett had for the most part traded in his homespun lyrical sense of humor in favor of a more serious and sentimental side, which many of JBs fans never fully saw or heard until this sophomore effort. But, thats not to say that Jimmy Buffett cant compose a humorous song without sounding too mish-mosh or overbearing, which in either case he doesnt. Whatever few humorous songs there are on "Living And Dying...", the combination of these with the more straightforward, subtle selections works wonders on an album of fine caliber such as this. Buffett felt he had something to prove to his increasingly growing audiences, and therefore needed to make a statement by writing wholehearted, contemporary ballads, such as "Come Monday" and "Ringling, Ringling", although the latter number is more of an up-tempo sort of ballad. "Come Monday" was also Buffetts first hit single, reaching the Top 30 of the Billboard pop charts in early 1974. JBs lightweight humor on "Pencil Thin Mustache" looks good on both paper and in the music itself, while "Gods Own Drunk" is 360 degrees of pure comic relief, combined with masterful, impressionistic humor performed in classic Jimmy Buffett style! Not one bad moment can be found on "Living And Dying...", and that includes all the other compositions as well, which makes it the best of the early Buffett CDs. A word of caution for the younger generation of "ParrotHeads" - due to the nature of the heavily influenced country sounds as featured on this selection, you might find "Living And Dying..." a bit hard to digest at first. But, once you begin to understand its unique nuances and down-home charm, youll definitely take it at face value, and will want to add it to your must have Jimmy Buffett collection. Since this title is virtually out of print in most areas, you should order it soon, although theres a rather distinct possiblity that either MCA Records or Jimmy Buffett himself will re-release his catalogue of older JB titles on his own label (Margaritaville), complete with the remaster treatment, including the  original artwork and liner notes in the CD booklet. But, as they say, theres nothing like an original. Thus, MCAs "Compact Disc-Compact Price" edition of "Living And Dying In 3/4 Time" is destined to become a collectors item. Its the best "old school" Buffett money can buy!      ',nonspam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000001EGA	November 5, 2001	4	4	5.0	Elton hits a grand slam...and out of the park too!!!	 "Captain Fantastic And The Brown Dirt Cowboy" finds Elton John at the apex of his then six year solo career at the time (remember, he got his start as a member of an r & b group known as Bluesology in the sixties, along with co-members Long John Baldry and Elton Dean, from where the previously known Reg Dwight found his stage name - Elton John [the one and only, of course!]). Although "Captain Fantastic..." is not as dominant musically as EJs previous albums, there are still some marvelous hidden gems, nonetheless, such as the glam rockers "Bitter Fingers" and the CDs title track. The selections featured on the first half and on the beginning of the second half of "Captain Fantastic...", in the lyrics dept., as well as the music itself, contain many positive, fluent vibes, which will leave one in an adventurous state of mind, to say the least. As for the last four songs ("Better Off Dead", "Writing", "We All Fall In Love Sometimes" and "Curtains"), it seems as if EJs and Bernie Taupins ideas were beginning to lose steam (especially in the latter three above compositions), and, as a result, it appears these two hitmeisters were bored by the whole music scene. What is also surprising, is that the mega-hits "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds" and "Philadelphia Freedom" are displayed here....as bonus tracks?! I thought these were part of the original album! The discs lone track, "Someone Saved My Life Tonight", is insightful and desperately thought-provoking, and contains a cute semibiographical reference - "sugar bear". I also found it interesting that the record company erred in forgetting to include "Dogs In The Kitchen" on this disc, as the lyrics included in the CD booklet look interesting enough. Even though Elton, Davey Johnstone, Nigel Olsson, Dee Murray & Co. werent quite as original or inventive in their playing on this disc as in previous outings, "Captain Fantastic..." still gets high marks for its unique scope and creativeness, and that says a lot about these talented musicians. A few months later, Elton would release his next record - "Rock Of The Westies", in the autumn of 75. That particular record proved to be somewhat weaker than "Capt. Fantastic..." - the reason being that both Nigel Olsson and Dee Murray were fired by Elton earlier in 75 after the release of "Capt. Fantastic...", and were replaced by original Elton John Band member Roger Pope on drums, as well as a new bassist, Kenny Passerelli, who previously performed in Joe Walshs group, among others. Both Olsson and Murray were sorely missed by fans, and brought a unique style and brand of creativity to the Elton John Band during this period, although I believe both were rehired later in Eltons career. "Captain Fantastic" is fantastic at that, and should not be missed by any Elton John fan, whether they be a diehard or casual fan.      ',spam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000001EGC	November 2, 2001	0	0	5.0	The Elton John-Bernie Taupin Connection	 "Madman Across The Water" is perhaps Elton Johns and Bernie Taupins most creative musical and lyrical output, when compared with their other stellar early 70s albums for a number of reasons. For instance, "MATW"s two opening tracks, "Tiny Dancer" and "Levon", both display a vibrant orchestral fluidity (especially the latter selection), as well as a unique, melancholic autobiographical charm (moreso prevalent in "Levon"). "Tiny Dancer" was written about Taupins girlfriend at the time, a dancer named Maxine Feibelman. What makes "Madman..." a musicians clinic, are the percussive guitar and mandolin skills, which are craftfully provided by the likes of drummer Roger Pope and axeman extraordinaire Davey Johnstone - whose talents on the mandolin are quite exceptional on the road-heavy "Holiday Inn". Johnstone would become a full-fledged member of The Elton John Band by the time EJs next LP, "Honky Chateau", was released the following year in 1972. Adding to this standout array of musicianship, is guest Rick Wakeman, whose playing on a majority of "MATW"s tracks is sometimes barely audible, and on selections such as "Razor Face", he pulls it off in spades. Wakeman would soon leave the Strawbs and join Yes after working on this album. Also introduced to the band are bassist Dee Murray and drummer Nigel Olsson, both of whom appear on one track, the impeccably overwraught "All The Nasties". Both Murray and Olsson would become prime-time EJ Band members also by the release of "Honky Chateau". The CDs title track is sure to give even the most casual Elton John fan "suspensful down your spine chills and thrills", courtesy of "Madmans..." intense lyrical and orchestral jinegar. EJ and BT both paint a rich, textured Native American cultural landscape and soundscape in "Indian Sunset", as if they realistically transported themselves back in time and dwelled amongst the natives (not bad for a couple of Brits, wouldnt you say?). The lyrics of "Rotten Peaches" would focus on the sad sack trial and tribulation nature found in a majority of Eltons and Bernies musical and lyrical compositions in future albums as well. For these two songbirds, that is a very good thing, for fans of these two compositional wonders wouldnt have it any other way, including yours truly. "Goodbye" is a fitting end to the CDs macabre, storybook-like novella. "Madman Across The Water" is an absolute must for all die-hard Eltonians to have in their CD collection(s). Arent you just "dying" to have this title in your Elton John library right about now?      ',spam

Produced by Randy Bachman (The Guess Who, Bachman-Turner Overdrive), for the most part, two of the selections here feature a bit of a BTO hook: the sassy "General Hand Grenade" and "Ready", both fine, outstanding rockers to boot, as are nearly all of the tracks on "Hot Shots". Trooper also bares its soulful side a la Pablo Cruise in "Round Round We Go". "Moment That It Takes" also displays a softer side. Neither of these two tracks fit in the general musical mold of the Trooper sound, which is earth shaking, in your face, Canadian rock n roll at its ultra-rocking best! Although the above-mentioned tracks are well worth the price of this disc, the real reason for making "Hot Shots" an essential purchase, is due to these outstanding CanCon classics: "Two For The Show", "Santa Maria", "Were Here For A Good Time (Not A Long Time)" and perhaps Troopers best known rock anthem "Raise A Little Hell". These hits are all yours at an import level price, although it is worth the money. This is truly the ultimate party "crank up the volume and bug your landlord (or landlady)" CD.

' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000002PD7	October 28, 2001	1	2	5.0	A welcome first effort for Steely Dan	 Although Steely Dan is primarily known as a musical group renowned for their jazz-laden intricacies, this groups first record, titled "Cant Buy A Thrill", is a masterpiece. "The Dan" combine rock and blues, with their trademark jazz musings "camouflaged" beneath a majority of the tracks featured here. The only "pure" jazz selections featured on "Cant Buy A Thrill" are found in "Fire In The Hole" and in the saxophone instrumental break of "Dirty Work". It is on this selection, along with "Brooklyn (Owes The Charmer Under Me)", where the smooth David Gates (lead singer of Bread)-like vocals of David Palmer are displayed with fine vocal precision, especially on "Dirty Work". The other "hidden" vocal presence on this disc is from Jim Hodder, on the down tempo "Midnite Cruiser". Hodders junior Randy Newman-esque vocals suit this track rather nicely. As I mentioned earlier, many of the tracks display either a moderately heavy rock feel ("Reelin In The Years", "Change Of The Guard"), or a bluesy sort of vibe ("Only A Fool Would Say That", "Dirty Work", "Turn That Heartbeat Over Again"). It is because of this interwoven nature of the three above-mentioned musical genres why "The Dan" gets five stars for originality. The musical and lyrical qualities of Donald Fagen and Walter Becker & Co. really shine through on "Cant Buy A Thrill". This disc proved to be Palmers and Hodders swan song with the group, as they were relieved of their vocal duties prior to Steely Dans next release, 1973s "Countdown To Ecstasy", where "The Dan" have their jazz stylings down to perfection from that point forward - at least until their much later efforts, but that will be dealt with in future Steely Dan reviews of other CDs. Youll experience many a "Thrill" during repeated listenings. This one has it all! A note of interest: Did you know Saturday Night Live alumnus and star of several motion pictures, Chevy Chase, was a member of Steely Dan years before they hit it big? Yep, Chevy, Fagen and Becker attended the same college in New Jersey (Bard College, I believe). Chase was quoted as saying they were "a bad jazz band" during his tenure with the group.

' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000002PBF	October 28, 2001	4	4	4.0	The return of Bernie Taupin	 "21 At 33" marks a slight return to form for Bernie Taupins partnership with Elton John. These two hitmakers last collaborated on the 1976 release "Blue Moves", which, rather surprisingly, contained only one U.S. Billboard chart single - 1977s "Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word". "21 At 33" starts things off musically in rip-roaring fashion with the up-tempo "Chasing The Crown", one of three EJ-BT compositions on this disc (the other two being the well-travelled "Two Rooms At The End Of The World" and the depressing "White Lady White Powder", where Elton begins his long-winded battle with cocaine). The majority of the other tracks here were written by Tom Robinson, including the gay dulcet tones of "Sartorial Eloquence" and the subtleness displayed in the discs major hit "Little Jeannie", although this particular track was written by Gary Osborne, who also made lyrical contributions to "21 At 33" with the serene and sincere compositions "Dear God" and "Take Me Back" (which isnt quite as serene as "Dear God", but has a small degree of serenity to it, nonetheless). But, the main thing that makes "21 At 33" such a standout masterpiece is the musical versatility EJ and his band display on two tracks, "Take Me Back", as mentioned above, with its countrified, hillbilly-laden, violin feel and on "Give Me The Love", with its smooth jazzy, discofied nuances (although the disco movement virtually ceased to exist by the time "21 At 33" was first released in 1980). The latter track was also written by Judie Tzuke, who accompanied Elton on his "21 At 33" tour in 1980. Another nice thing about listening to this disc, is that Eltons vocals started to mature a bit (although I do miss those classic Elton vocals from the 70s), and are a suitable fit to the lyrics displayed in these songs. This disc was also the last EJ would record on the MCA label before signing with Geffen Records, that is, until he returned to MCA with the 1988 release "Reg Strikes Back". So, if youre a true Elton John fan, and you dont have "21 At 33" in your CD collection, what are you waiting for? Better get it soon, because it just may be gone tomorrow!      ',nonspam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000001DQI	August 15, 2001	4	5	5.0	Eltons Pot Of Gold At The End Of The Yellow Brick Road!	 After being treated to the multi-million selling, mega-smash "Dont Shoot Me Im Only The Piano Player", the millions upon millions of Elton Johns already established fans were most likely wondering "What could possibly top that masterpiece?" If that was their thought, well, they were almost correct. EJs 1973 follow-up, "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road", may not top "Dont Shoot Me..." both musically or lyrically, but "GYBR" is as just as masterful a work as "DSM..." on both artistic fronts. But, what gives "...Yellow Brick Road" its magical touch, is the rather diversive musical/ lyrical textures and stylings featured throughout this CD, which is really a double album containing 76 minutes of music at its sheer, ultra-rocking best. "GYBR" starts off with a chilling feel, with the hauntingly spooky "Funeral For A Friend (Love Lies Bleeding)". The first half of this track is an instrumental, while the second half kicks into maximum overdrive, courtesy of Eltons aggressively rough-edged powerful vocals and his hard-hitting band, who provide some serious licks, particularly in the rhythm section on guitar by the one and only Davey Johnstone. In comparing both original versions of "Grey Seal" (which appeared on Eltons second self-titled album as a bonus track) and "Candle In The Wind" to the remakes, the revamped version of the former track is most likely the preferred version among Elton fans (myself included), with its progressively up-tempo syncopation, although the slower-paced, ballad type version is suitable (although Ive only heard snippets of the original). As for both studio and live versions of "Candle...", both are equal, with Eltons more powerful, rough and melancholy vocals, as well as classical piano nimblings featured beautifully in the live version, making it more suitable to the fact-based biographical lyrics of one of Hollywoods best known starlets, Marilyn Monroe. In keeping with the movies, theres "Ive Seen That Movie Too", complete with the CD booklets ultra-hip, cool artwork - displaying a scene from "Gone With The Wind", of Clark Gable (as Rhett Butler) and Vivien Leigh (as Scarlett OHara), who seem to be enjoying a romantic moment, via a kiss. Adding to the plethora of those diversive musical styles, is the reggae-ish "Jamaica Jerk-Off", recorded in Jamaica, as was "Saturday Nights Alright For Fighting", one of "GYBRs many hit singles, with the latter number featuring driven-home, serious rock n roll, once again carried out very solidly by Eltons band (as a further note of interest, "GYBR" was the third album recorded mostly at Strawberry Studios in France, with two of the above tracks "Jamaica Jerk-Off" and "Saturday Nights"..., recorded in Jamaica, as noted above). The albums other singles, "Bennie And The Jets", "Harmony" and the title track, are hypnotically romantic and sensible, particularly the latter two, with the former being good glamourized rock n roll. EJs 1950s rock influences are showcased in the speedily up-tempo "Your Sister Cant Twist (But She Can Rock n Roll)". Theres also a bit of a hook of "Madman Across The Water" prominently displayed in "Dirty Little Girl", a song centering around the ring of prostitution. "Social Disease" is a colorful look at alcoholism, which explains the nature of Elton and Bernie Taupins lighthearted, jovial musical and lyrical nature of the albums songs (Im not suggesting that neither Elton nor Bernie have ever taken to the bottle on a consistent basis - this analogy just happened to come out that way. Sorry!). Thus, this is most likely the album in which EJ and Bernie were having the most fun during their six year partnership at the time. After writing mostly melancholy tunes on the previous albums, both EJ and Bernie probably thought: "Hey, why dont we throw our usually (wonderfully) depressive ideas to the wind and see if anything uniquely unusual comes up." That it did. The result was a more dynamic, laid-back masterpiece, which Taupin and John later explored in future efforts. The snazzy, semi-cartoonish, semi-dramatic and visually stunning CD booklet artwork is simply a joy to behold, which says a lot for the musical and lyrical content inside, and is perhaps the finest of EJs and Bernies early period. Success would continue to shine for these two genuinely unique players, who provide the best compositions the world of rock music has to offer. So, take that georgeous walk down the yellow brick road to your local record store today, and get a copy of "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road". Its the ultimate pot of gold!      ',spam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000001EGE	August 11, 2001	2	2	4.0	Wonderfully Cold and Pessimistic	 Elton Johns "Honky Chateau" LP, released in 1972, contains some of lyrical partner Bernie Taupins most interpersonal and melancholic lyrics to date. As I understand, Elton John was going through some pretty rocky times at the release of this recording. As a result, Taupins kaleidoscopic lyrics really show. Elton John basically struggled through depression throughout much of his career, which led to experimentation with various drugs later on, including cocaine (which almost killed him in 1990). Elton even had thoughts of suicide early in his career, which is a theme presented in one of the selections here, titled "I Think Im Gonna Kill Myself". The gay nineties styled music wonderfully offsets the depressed lyrics in this track, as is the case in contrast throughout most of "Honky Chateau"s selections. Elton was also experiencing some relationship problems during this era. Songs such as "Susie (Dramas)" and "Amy" make light of these relationship dilemmas, but once again, the uplifting musical arrangements featured in these two tracks adds a silver lining to these dark, lyrical clouds. "Mellow" and "Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters" teeter on the brink a bit, although the latter number sort of probes the dog eat dog world in which we live. Quite possibly, Elton transcribed Bernies lyrics into prayer, as is the case in the semi-optimistic "Salvation", to help EJ cope with his difficult struggles in dealing with his rise to fame, relationships, insecurities, etc. "Hercules" (Eltons "newly adopted" legal middle name by this time) displays EJs newfound confidence being restored in the Relationships, Inc. department, as noted in the lyrics, as well as in the uptempo musical cohesiveness provided courtesy of Davey Johnstones guitar licks and Nigel Olssons powerful drumming technique, which is the albums saving grace in response to the somewhat down in the mouth lyrics, which have a wonderful appeal all their own. "HC"s lone bonus track "Slave (Alternate Version)" is too uptempo, although it has a nice Jerry Lee Lewis quality to it, courtesy of EJs quick piano ramblings. The slower version of this track, also featured here, works better on record, and fits in more comfortably with the rest of the album. "Honky Chateau"s star tracks, "Rocket Man" and "Honky Cat" are out of the ordinary, good time standards, particularly the latter track. The Mardi Gras atmosphere of "Honky Cat" is superseded by the sci-fi theme prevalent in "Rocket Man", which gives this track an unparalleled coolness. What makes "Honky Chateau" special as well, is that it is the first in a series of Elton John albums that were recorded at the famed Strawberry Studios, located in France. EJs next album, "Dont Shoot Me Im Only The Piano Player" was also recorded at this same studio, and is the album that pushed Elton into international superstar status. The cold, pessimistic atmosphere of "Honky Chateau" is aesthetically pleasing, and is among EJs and Taupins most decoratively cherished works, which are the all-time best in the world of pop music. Folks, its that simple, you need this CD in your Elton John and/or pop music library today!      ',nonspam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000001EG8	August 11, 2001	1	2	4.0	A worthy first effort	 "Empty Sky", Elton Johns introductory 1969 release, briefly provides a glimpse forward to his signature piano based sound, which Elton would soon master over the course of his next two albums. For starters, the harpsichord featured here somewhat lightens the melancholy mood evident in many of the songs, which is a good thing, considering the fact that this lovely sounding musical instrument would never again make a full-fledged presence in Eltons later efforts, with the exception of his next release. The tracks on "Empty Sky" which feature any semblance of EJs later works are those of "Western Ford Gateway", which features an out of this universe echoed vocal display, and "Lady Whats Tommorrow", featuring an appearance by future Elton John Band Member Nigel Olsson on drums. The CDs opening title track is eight and a half minutes of sheer rocktopia, while the suite "Gulliver/Its Hay Chewed/Reprise" features a uniquely jazzy middle section with a medley of the albums previous tunes in the suites finale. The harpsichord featured in "Skyline Pigeon" is uplifting, but I prefer the piano version of this track, as featured on the also remastered version of "Dont Shoot Me Im Only The Piano Player". The piano version of "Skyline Pigeon" is an EJ masterpiece, and is absolutely breathtaking! The cream of the bonus tracks is the hard-polished rocker "Lady Samantha", which was also covered by Three Dog Night on their second LP "Suitable For Framing", which was out at the same time as "Empty Sky". TDNs version of "Lady Samantha" just barely gets the nod over EJs version, primarily due to TDNs musical cohesiveness, as displayed on their version. For the most part, "Empty Sky" is basically Elton John getting his feet wet, and is a noteworthy body of musical and lyrical works, with the latter masterfully supplied by Bernie Taupin, who would remain partnered with Elton John throughout the majority of Eltons career, except for the period between 1978 through 1980. It is this latter period where Eltons arrangements are the most mediocre, and that says a lot for this piano masters early career, which got off to a nice, humble start, courtesy of "Empty Sky", which is the place to start to get to know the man known as Elton John and his music.

' A103KNDW8GN92L	B00005MKDL	August 11, 2001	4	4	5.0	A return to form in grand Diamondesque fashion!	 "Three Chord Opera" is Neil Diamonds first CD of original material since the 1996 release "Tennessee Moon", as well as his first overall in nearly three years since 1998s "The Movie Album: As Time Goes By". "TCO" is perhaps a slight return to form in the way of original material since Neils release of "Lovescape" ten years prior. "TCO" can be classified as the ultimate feel-good Neil Diamond CD, with its upbeat, inspirational messages, as contained in the selections "Dont Look Down", "Baby Lets Drive" and "Leave A Little Room For God". "At The Movies" has a lush, conceptive feel to it in regard to the lyrics, and is just plain fun! Classic Diamond romantic fare and sound can also be found in the many tracks featured on "TCO", as in "I Havent Played This Song In Years", "I Believe In Happy Endings", "Midnight Dream", "You Are The Best Part Of Me" and "Turn Down The Lights" are many true Diamond gems just waiting to be discovered. Neil pays a nice, lovely tribute to his son on "Elijahs Song", and should not be ignored or overlooked. The same can be said for the rest of the songs on "TCO", which is destined to become a rare Diamond masterwork, as well as yet another multi-million seller in the virtual Diamondville gold, or perhaps platinum mine. Many a listener will be fooled upon first glance of the CDs cover (featuring Neil holding an acoustic guitar), into thinking the songs have a complete acoustic nature. One further look at the cover (with Neil wearing a black leather jacket) should somewhat explain the tone of the songs, which will surprise the listener upon the very first listen. "Three Chord Opera" is one CD for the ages, thus, any "Diamondhead" would be foolish to pass this one up!      ',spam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B00000DPSP	August 10, 2001	2	2	4.0	A worthy tribute to Mr. Neil Diamond!	 In honor of Neil Diamonds 35 years in the music industry as a recording artist (as well as a songwriter, which spans a total of some 40 years plus, going back to the late 50s, when Neil wrote his first song for his girlfriend titled "Hear Them Bells"), comes this 2001 reissue of the 1998 release "Colin Anthony Performs A Tribute To Neil Diamond". Although Mr. Anthonys semi-smooth, semi-gruff vocals make this collection of Neils most popular 1970s and early 80s hits worthy of many a listen, his vocals dont come close to "The Master Himself", but are still quite good. The orchestration in this version of "Mr. Bojangles" sounds exactly like Neils original LP version (as heard on "Touching You, Touching Me"). One must wonder if Lee Holdridge conducted the arrangements on this version as well, including the rest of the arrangements featured on this fine tributary to Mr. Diamond. The bouncy intro of "Cracklin Rosie" is also worth the price of this CD, as are all the musical selections here. As for the female vocalization on "You Dont Bring Me Flowers", it is well done, except for the high range parts, which are too much a task for this particular uncredited singer to handle. Colins vocals keep this tune in check, nonetheless. With all the success Neil Diamond has achieved throughout his long and illustrious career, its a wonder why more tributes arent done in his honor, either live or on record (or on CD, whichever you prefer). If youre a true "Diamondhead" who enjoys hearing Neils hits done in a rather unique style by a different performer, then youll be pleased as punch to add this wonderful tribute CD to your burgeoning Neil Diamond collection!

' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000002PBN	July 23, 2001	0	1	5.0	Mellow Buffett	 The 1977 release "Changes In Latitudes, Changes In Attitudes", continues with Jimmy Buffetts shift away from the country music sound, as featured in his earlier albums, and more toward the Carribean sound he would become well noted for amongst his legions of "ParrotHeads". "Changes..." is a ParrotHeads paradise, as displayed in the CDs two hit singles - the title track and "Margaritaville", which contains a dated reference of yesteryear - the venerable pop-top. These pull-off ring tabs, mostly featured on both soda and beer cans, ceased production around 1980 for soda cans (1980 was also the year when most soda canneries opted for aluminum over steel cans). Thus, the pull-off tabs were replaced in favor of more stationary pull-back tabs. The pull-backs resulted in fewer minor skin abrasions (including fewer use of band-aids), thus being beneficial for the consumer. The conventional pull-back, peel-off ring tabs were continually being used on some beer cans up until around the mid 1990s or so. Getting back to the main review, a majority of the remaining tracks are comprised of easy listening flair, as featured in such selections as "Wonder Why We Ever Go Home", "Lovely Cruise", "In The Shelter", among others. "Tampico Trauma" is a number that somewhat capitalizes on those Caribbean influences, as mentioned above. For songs with a bit of a harder edge, theres the title track and the closer "Landfall". It is on "Changes..." that Buffett really puts his best foot forward into his unique storytelling and songwriting talents, and definitely should not be overlooked by any die-hard ParrotHead by any means. For best results, serve chilled - shaken, not stirred!      ',spam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000002PE4	July 23, 2001	2	2	4.0	The first punk-rock album	 Of all the British Invasion groups to emerge in the 60s - The Animals, Hermans Hermits, The Rolling Stones, The Beatles and others, no group brought together a unique sound and style quite like The Who. What made this groups sixties albums so omniprescent was that they were the first remnants of the punk era, which didnt emerge full scale until a decade later. "The Who Sings My Generation" has the punk seal of approval artistically etched into almost all of the songs. Keith Moon would soon become a household name in the annals of rock music notariety, and would carve his own musical niche with his inventive, over the top drum playing, in much the same style players such as Jimi Hendrix and Terry Kath (Chicago [Transit Authority] would soon bring to their guitar playing wizardries. Evidence of Moons unorthodox drum intracacies is heard in the instrumental "The Ox", "La La La Lies" and "My Generation", and would soon blaze a trail for other drummers to follow, with the likes of John Bonham and Phil Collins, among others. The Who shows here they can stylize an R & B number with tremendous fashion, as in the soul-grabbing "Please, Please, Please". Since this album is considered by many to be the first punk album, "The Who Sings My Generation" would soon pave the way for a new generation of punk rockers a decade after its release. Another unique element which spices up a majority of the tracks displayed here are the rough, hard-edged and the soft, bluesy vocal musings of Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend, whose masterful, one-off guitar stylings pull this CD through with such brevity and sheer gusto. John Entwistles bass-playing qualities complete an artistical, well-honed musical picture, which would make any hardcore punk fan pround to declare his allegiance to the genre. Now, if producer Shel Talmy would allow MCA to remaster this one of a kind gem, which is in need of the remaster treatment, to which The Whos other CDs in their catalog have received. Until then, The Whos many fans will just have to make do with this standout masterpiece, which has stood the test of time, even more than thirty-five years after its release. "The Who Sings My Generation" is definitely one CD for the ages, and belongs on every The Who fans shopping list.      ',nonspam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000002W6M	July 22, 2001	2	3	4.0	Nice fusion of R & B, Rock & Soul	 Judging from the sounds featured on "H2O", it becomes very clear why the 1980s was the decade of Daryl Hall & John Oates. For one reason, the radio airwaves were saturated with this duos many chart hits in the early part of the decade. Released in the latter half of 82, "H2O" features the smash singles "Maneater" - with its semi-graphic video, "Family Man" and the mellow and melancholy "One On One". But, what really makes this album (CD) worth getting are the non-singles "At Tension" - complete with a military theme, as well as "Go Solo", an interpersonal, head-gamey, rocking love ballad. "Italian Girls" is wonderful, too. Here, John Oates puts his foreign language skills to fairly good use, as he speaks the line "faccia bella cara mia" with an interesting Italian flair that would even make Mama Celeste proud. All in all, "H2O" is a good album, and is one of Hall & Oates better early 80s efforts. Their follow-up album "Rock & Soul Part I" would prove to be equally successful, earning rock musics most successful duo yet another huge selling record. After the heavy synth influenced "Big Bam Boom" LP (which also was a big seller), released in 1984, H & Os following two releases, 1988s "Ooh Yeah!" and 1990s "Change of Season", didnt quite hit the mark musically, and the duo split up in the early 90s, only to reunite a few years later for 1997s "Marigold Sky". Although Hall & Oates may not be quite the musical entity they were many years ago, they left their mark on the rock era in a big way, to which many acts in rock music, including todays or yesteryears acts, have a long way to go to match H & Os influence on the rock music scene, which is phenomenal. What this means is that Hall & Oates record as the most successful duo in rock music history isnt likely to be broken anytime soon.      ',nonspam

This Calgary-based trio, fronted by Rick Dodson, Ronnie King and Kim Berly, saw major success in the U.S. with their hit single "Sweet City Woman", which cracked the Billboard Top Ten in 1971, and is one of the songs featured in this collection. Of the fourteen tracks (on the Collectables Records edition) featured on "Sweet City Woman - A Golden Classics Edition", twelve of them are pure CanCon (Canadian Content) radio classics. The Stampeders are more than just a country-rock band, as the songs in this collection signify.

Of the few less humorous songs on "A1A", "A Pirate Looks At Forty" is probably the most prospective, and is a companion song both musically and lyrically to "The Captain And The Kid, from "Havana Daydreamin". "Trying To Reason With Hurricane Season" has its wonderfully tense moments, as the citizens of the island of Kauai have been in the same situation with Iniki in 92. With "A1A", Buffett still finds himself in his country phase, and the rest of the songs here are fine compositions as well. Pretty much from this point forward, Buffett would delve into more Caribbean influences in further developing his sound, which would net him a new "flock" of fans known as "ParrotHeads". If youre unable to make it down to Key West, just play "A1A" on your stereo, fill a "Tin Cup Chalice" with good red wine, or fire up some lime daiquiris in the ol blender, whichever you prefer, chew on some honeysuckle, and youll think youre in paradise, on the beach, away from your hectic and hurry world.

This insight is well-scoped out in such tracks as "Silent Talking" and "Water From The Moon".

A very tender ballad is featured in "Eurasian Eyes", with wonderful lyrical and musical content, which is brilliantly played to the hilt. The star ballads on "Box" belong to both of the albums singles "Never Surrender", a song about searching for lost love and having the courage to make your own choices in the face of adversity, and "Everything In My Heart", a powerful soul-grabbing number. "Komrade Kiev" deals with the cut-throat pressures of the Cold War in a serious manner, while "Waiting For You" is absolutely fun.

The 1980s, as well as the latter half of the 1970s, proved to be the most successful decade and a half of Kenny Rogers music career, as he ascertained a majority of hits on both the pop and country charts during those two decades, respectively. The 1983 effort "Weve Got Tonight" is no exception, as it contains one pop/country/AC (adult contemporary) hit, titled "All My Life", with the rest of the tracks being predominantly country, of course. Either a country or pop music afficianado will find these selections a true winner: the title track, which features Kenny performing a duet with Scottish pop siren Sheena Easton, the introspective "What I Learned From Loving You" and the Joe Cocker remake "You Are So Beautiful", among them. It is on "YASB" where KR provides his smooth, gruff trademark vocals. "Bad Enough" and "Farther I Go" are also superbly done musical and lyrical compositions as well, with both latter tracks featuring up-tempo, bouncy choruses.

"Lock Up" features a strong cast with the likes of Sylvester Stallone, Donald Sutherland, John Amos, Tom Sizemore and Sonny Landham. Stallone portrays Frank Leone, who must serve the remaining six months of his sentence at a minimum security correctional facility. Leones cell is ransacked in the middle of the night and is taken into custody against his will by security guards from a maximum security prison, where Leone is escorted and is promptly given the guided tour of hell. The viewer, as well as Leone, is then given an explanation of Leones transfer, courtesy of one evil Warden Drumgoole, played by Sutherland. The tone of the movie is set upon Drumgooles intense greeting: "Welcome to Gateway, Leone". Its payback time, according to the warden, whose administration was publicly humiliated by Leone, whom Warden Drumgoole makes sure never has another pleasureable moment during Leones sentence. Leones stay isnt entirely unbearable, for there are a few bright spots here, as our beloved convict-hero makes some fast friends in the prison autobody shop, with the likes of Eclipse (Frank McRae), Dallas (Tom Sizemore) and First Base (Larry Romano). It is here where these individuals share a common bond of friendship, including their love of cars, which is one of "Lock Ups" few tender moments. Ah, but there cant be friends without enemies, can there? Frank finds his enemy at a prison football game, where he is brutally roughhoused by one Chink Weber (Sonny Landham). Things dont get any easier for Leone, as he is constantly belittled and brutally assaulted by Drumgooles staff. Overall, this is a strong film, with some believable characters, although the plot in certain spots is somewhat weak and unbelievable. For instance, I find it hard to believe that a prison autobody shop, such as this, displays little or no security, as well as a large maximum security prison, like this one, being overseen by just one warden, who, out of hundreds and hundreds of inmates, is so obsessed with just one of them. Im sure the warden has other responsibilities to be concerned about, which Im sure are many. But, the one good thing about watching a film of this caliber is that the wardens obsession with one man builds an intense climax that leaves the viewer on the edge of his/her seat the entire length of the movie, thus craving more substantial thrills and dialog. "Lock Up" contains all of the above, and is one film youre sure to come back to time and again. Plus, no other actor can bring more to an action-thriller quite like Sly Stallone, although "Lock Up" probably isnt his best role. That honor would have to go to his Rambo and Rocky roles. When viewing "Lock Up", make sure you have a spare key (and some refreshments) handy at all times, because you never know how long your stay of execution will last!      ',nonspam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000002J1W	July 11, 2001	1	1	4.0	Commendable first effort	 For those who are familiar with the progressive rock Yes is noteworthy for, you may be surprised when you listen to this, Yes first offering. The reason for your probable surprise is that very few, if any of the tracks featured on "Yes", display any sort of a progressive feel. The closest thing to progressive rock is most likely found in the opening track "Beyond And Before" and in "Looking Around". Otherwise, the rest of the tracks display either a softer, more mellow feel (the melancholy ballad "Yesterday And Today", the equally touching "Harold Land" and "Sweetness") or a rather bluesy perspective ("I See You"). The band has its one and only cover tune, and it graces this first album in fine musical form - the Beatles tune "Every Little Thing", a nice, quaint rocker. "Survival" closes things out nicely, although somewhat on a somber note. Even though it would take a few more albums for Yes to reach their full blown progressive pinnacle, that being on "Fragile", when Rick Wakeman and Steve Howe joined the band (although Howe became part of Yes during their previous album "The Yes Album", an effort that features some noteworthy progressive chops). That said, this first effort, titled "Yes", is not a bad album, to say the least - for on the groups next album "Time And A Word" (the last to feature guitarist Peter Banks), there would be a sign of things to come in the realm of Yes style of progressive rock, which is somewhat absent on this first effort. If youre a completist, youll definitely want "Yes" in your CD library. Even if you arent a fan of this band, but are a fan of more "casual" rock, you just might want to make this title an essential purchase before Atlantic decides to take it out of print.      ',nonspam

Originally released on the Uni label in the late 60s/early 70s, its such a real treat to hear Neil perform some of his early Bang material live, as featured on this CD, and he really breathes life into these live numbers to boot. "Lordy", "Cherry, Cherry", "Thank The Lord For The Night Time" and "Brother Loves Traveling Salvation Show" (the former three tracks are from the Bang years) really showcase Neils ability to rock with a little bit of a hard edge in all-out fashion, while the live versions of "Holly Holy" and "Sweet Caroline" featured here dont work quite as well without an orchestra. The orchestral arrangements work wonders on both "Holly Holy" and "Sweet Caroline", where these particular live versions can be found on the double live "Hot August Night" CD set, complete with orchestral arrangements, as mentioned above. Neil really tops himself on the live "GOLD" version of "Brother Loves", as opposed to the original studio version, as he puts a signature, hard-edged polish on this live version, where Mr. Diamond rocks out like no one else Ive heard before, or since. There are no duds here in this semi-acoustic live masterpiece. "Neil Diamond GOLD" is a perfect CD to relax with after a long, hard day.      ',spam

The CDs strong points are well stated in the tracks "Makin It" (David Naughton),"Save Your Kisses For Me" (Brotherhood Of Man), the unique and untimely instrumental "Feels So Good" (Chuck Mangione), the Bee Gees penned "Emotion" (Samantha Sang). The strongest of these strong points in this collection is the Andrew Gold smash "Thank You For Being A Friend" (which, of course was later re-recorded by an unknown artist and was used as the theme of the hit 80s sitcom "The Golden Girls"). Lets not forget the Elvis Presley tribute song "The King Is Gone", complete with a well-styled Presley-like vocal, courtesy of Ronnie McDowell. Unfortunately, the weaker tracks noticeably offset the stronger ones. Therefore, Rhino could have put better songs in the place of such horrendous tracks as the Eric Carmen penned "Hey Deanie" (Shaun Cassidy), "Love Fire" (Jigsaw), "Everybody Be Dancin" (Starbuck) [with these two groups putting out much stronger previous tracks with "Sky High" and "Moonlight Feels Right", respectively, which are also contained in previous volumes in this 70s series] and perhaps the most horrendous track of all, which rears its ugly head here with "Did You Boogie With Your Baby" (Flash Cadillac & The Continental Kids). "Vol. 24" provides adequate middle ground, as featured in the tracks "Heaven On The 7th Floor" (Paul Nicholas) and in the doo-wop styled "Street Corner Serenade" (Wet Willie). Even though "Vol. 24" is perhaps the most mediocre effort of this 25 volume CD series, youll find that there are better volumes in this series, hands down.

Since there are so many good songs on "Super Hits of the 70s - Have A Nice Day Vol. 20", hitting the continuation button on your stereo is highly recommended for a number of reasons. Volume 20 of this 25 volume series spotlights the pop/Top 40 hits from 1976-77. There are untimely classic ballads of the tear-jerker variety found in Peter McCanns "Do You Wanna Make Love" (released in the late summer of 77) and in Engelbert Humperdincks "After The Lovin" (released at the beginning of 77). Continuing through the ballads, Seals & Crofts feature one of their final chart hits from late summer 76 with the up close and personal "Get Closer", while Mac Daviss "Baby Dont Get Hooked On Me" predates this collection of hits by some four to five years, with a release date of 1972. A hits collection wouldnt be a hits collection without the smooth, mellow vocal stylings of Cliff Richard, whose ghoulish smash hit "Devil Woman", is featured in this wonderful array of mostly late 70s favorites. Of David Geddes two 1975 chart hits titled "Run Joey Run" (which can be found on Vol. 15) and "The Last Game of the Season (A Blind Man In The Bleachers)", the former tune is just downright crude and horrible, while the latter track is warm and sentimental, and therefore, fits rather snuggily into this collection with ease. Boomer Castlemans "Judy Mae" is the only weak entry of the bunch, whose lyrics sound a bit too "Hatfields and McCoys"-ish to suit me. Los Angeles based trio Hot had their only hit titled "Angel In Your Arms", which shows up here, and is yet another delightful ballad. This wouldnt be a true 70s collection without at least one disco song - that being "Disco Duck (Part I)", provided in a wacky style that only Rick Dees And His Cast Of Idiots can bring to the disco table. One-hit wonders Smokie had a major hit with "Living Next Door To Alice" in early 77. "Alice" was written by Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman, both of whom went on to even bigger glory as songwriters in the late 70s/early 80s for such artists as Exile, Bonnie Tyler and others. Smokie frontman Chris Norman teamed up with Suzi Quatro on the later hit "Stumblin In (found on Vol. 22). If youre into 50s nostalgia, theres Dean Friedmans "Ariel" to whet your appetite. If there is a best song on this CD, that honor should rightfully go to The Sanford/Townsend Bands one and only hit smash, the jazzy-bluesy "Smoke From A Distant Fire". With so many good songs to choose from in this stalwart collection of marvelous compositions, "Have A Nice Day Vol. 20" is one CD youll definitely come back to time and again. If youre a completist, youll need this one in your must have, must own collection. Keep in mind that each CD in this series has its own style of songs to suit different musical tastes, so its not necessary to collect all 25 CDs. On that note, it is most wise to pick and choose your favorites as you go along. "Vol. 20" is a sure-fire winner!      ',nonspam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	0800104803	July 9, 2001	4	5	5.0	Brilliantly Stunning...And Captivating!	 "To Sir With Love" is one of three Sidney Poitier cinematic masterpieces to grace the silver screen in 1967 (the other two being "In The Heat Of The Night" and "Guess Whos Coming To Dinner"). In "TS,WL", Poitier plays his part well as a nice, warmhearted schoolteacher. When unable to secure a job as a civil engineer, Mark Thackeray (Poitier) agrees to accept a position at North Quay (pronounced like "key") Secondary School in Londons tough East End. Mr. Thackeray quickly finds out he has his hands full with a bunch of hard to discipline teenagers at the outset. When he is unable to reach his students through conventional means of instruction with textbooks, Thackeray is forced to rely on utilizing a more simplified teaching strategy. He accomplishes this by arranging an outing to a local museum of classical art, and also by instructing his pupils in the basic culinary art of Home Economics. Thackerays newly found confidence is somewhat shaken amongst his students after an incident in the school gymnasium involving one of his pupils, and it is at this point where many of Thackerays students give him the cold shoulder treatment, with the exception of one Pamela Dare (played nicely by Judy Geeson), who seems to take to Thackeray like a fish to water. In the meantime, Mr. Thackeray applies for many civil engineering jobs via the mail with little success. Later on, when the students teacher is greeted with a warm reception at the final school dance, it begs the question: should Thackeray stay or go, but not before receiving confirmation (also via the mail) that hes been offered a position with a top engineering firm. For the answer to this burning question, youll just have to watch this dramatic display of fine acting to find out. Oh, and this film also features the fine vocal talents of Lulu, who is featured as one of Mr. Thackerays students, as well as sings the movies title song. The band who performs at the school dance is none other than "The Mindbenders", who were led by Wayne Fontana, and had a major hit with the song "The Game Of Love" before "TS,WL" was released. Make sure you include "To Sir, With Love" in your video library today, because acting of the highest caliber, such as this, only comes along once in a blue moon!      ',spam

' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000000HQJ	July 7, 2001	4	4	5.0	Outstanding quality of Progressive Jazz	 Feeling stifled creatively with Genesis, drummer Phil Collins felt he needed to take his musical skills to another level. Collins, along with guitarist John Goodsall (of the Average White Band), bassist Percy Jones and keyboardist Robin Lumley, formed Brand X in 1976. In this collection, with its correct title being "Brand X - A History: 1976-1980", these four musicians really sew their wild, jazz- oriented musical notes, with a little progressive rock musings interwoven into the jazzy rhythms. Phil Collins display of drumming is featured in the first six of the ten total instrumental tracks here. His pattern and technique is slightly different from the chops he displayed as a member of Genesis in this same time period. Here, Phils stylings are more shifted toward a jazz-oriented style of playing, as jazz is Collins most favorite genre of music at which he is very well adept, including being well honed in progressive rock too, of course. The opening tracks, "Nuclear Burn" and "Born Ugly", display both a jazzy-bluesy side of Brand X, while the tracks "Why Should I Lend You Mine (When Youve Broken Yours Off Already?)" and "Sun In The Night" feature a smooth jazz feel. Collins sings a chorus-like vocal in the middle of the latter track, with the former number also written by Phil. Upon hearing the live track "Isis Mourning Part 2" (written by Mr, Collins as well), one will notice that it sounds more like it was recorded in the studio, with an audience coda tacked on the end, but that isnt the case here. An outstanding live number, to say the least. Then, we move into the non-Collins tracks featured in this wonderful set, where, briefly Chuck Burghi, then Mike Clarke handle the drumming duties for the remainder of Brand Xs tenure (although Collins would generally perform on a few tracks of the bands subsequent albums while also continuing to perform as a member of Genesis). The first three in this latter set (The Poke, Dance Of The Illegal Alien and Pool Room Blues), sort of harken back to the funky side, as featured in the CDs first two tracks, although I wish "Pool Room Blues" had been extended a little longer, with its infectious funky-jazzy grooves and all. The finale, "Cambodia", has a rockier edge to it, which shows another side of the talents of these fine, well-schooled musicians. It isnt often you hear a jazz group with progressive pizazz, which is why the most diehard fan of either jazz or progressive rock should pick up a copy of "Brand X - A History: 1976-1980" as soon as possible, before it definitely becomes a part of history!

' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000002GQE	June 29, 2001	5	5	5.0	The best of the Moodys "pre-prog" works	 "Days of Future Passed" is considered a concept album, in that it eulogizes the various parts of the day from a timely musical standpoint. There is a bit of that Moody Blues rock sound displayed here, which is cleverly camouflaged against the orchestral stylings provided in grand fashion by "The London Festival Orchestra" - conducted by Peter Knight. "Days of Future Passed" begins and ends with a nice, very British vocal passage, voiced by the Moodys lead singer, Justin Hayward, whose vocalization serves as the perfect compliment to the orchestral passages displayed throughout this "Digitally Remastered" CD, which is truly a delight to the ears. The stuff displayed between the intro and outro vocal passages is prime stuff, which, as I said, captures the subleties of each part of the day with great musical precision. "THE DAY BEGINS" and "DAWN: Dawn Is A Feeling" blossom rather nicely, while "THE MORNING: Another Morning" moves through this day quite briskly. Before you know it, its time for a lunch break, which begins in the calming, then breaks out with a vengeful fury in the peak hour, thus you have "LUNCH BREAK: Peak Hour". "THE AFTERNOON" is now upon us, which prompts Justin Hayward to break out with a pleasant vocal set against a lush, orchestral waterfall, which is the setting for the subtitle a) Forever Afternoon. The orchestration sets the musical tone for the macabre b) subtitle "(Evening) Time To Get Away". It is now later in the "EVENING", and subtitle a) "The Sunset" is the perfect musical "cool down" right before the subtitle b) "Twilight Time". Finally, the dark of "THE NIGHT: Nights In White Satin" has now reached its glorious end, as the now died down "echo" of the orchestration senses it is "nighty-night" time, complete with a Justin Hayward bedtime story, titled "The Gathering Gloom". Ah, but as they say: "Alls Well That Ends Well", as we end one of the last chapters of the all orchestral, "pre-prog" Moody Blues era, as they would begin to hone their progressive musical skills as time passed with each album, although The Moodys did continue to infuse the orchestral sounds into their rock n roll landscape, particularly in later albums, such as "Long Distance Voyager", among others. After listening to this CD, it is clearly evident where the musical influences of various progressive groups, such as Genesis (the Peter Gabriel years) and Emerson, Lake and Palmer, came from. In fact, Genesis first album, "From Genesis To Revelation", sounds a lot like "DOFP", and is modeled after it. Although "Days of Future Passed" is primarily suited for the classical music lover, those who are into the classic rock sound of the late 60s, a la "The Bee Gees", et. al., will derive some pleasure from it, as well. But, be warned, "DOFP" isnt exactly for the "pure" rock n roll fan, nor is it for the "pure" classical music afficianado, but is for the true universal music lover. So, if you are only into the Moodys later, more progressive-oriented efforts, you might find "Days of Future Passed" a bit hard to swallow. But, if you are a die-hard fan of this supergroup, and you dont have this title in your CD collection, GET IT, PRONTO!!!      ',spam

As you listen to "Soundtracks" by Tony Banks, you may be misled, as well as lost, because the number of tracks contained on the actual CD (twelve), are different from the number shown on the back cover (six), including two suites with eight subtitles between the two. It is the subtitles of the "Quicksilver" and "Redwing" suites which throws the actual number of tracks on the CD out of kilter. Dont let these inconsistencies prevent you from enjoying the wonderful "Banksynths" on this CD, many of which Tony brought to the forefront on the last Genesis album, 1983s self-titled LP of the same name, aka "Shapes". Once you hear "Shortcut To Somewhere" (featuring vocals from Tonys ole buddy Fish [of "Marillion"], "You Call This Victory" (with vocals supplied by Jim Diamond), as well as the last subtitle of the "Quicksilver Suite" - "Final Chase", youll want to run a ten mile marathon, just to sweat the unsightly toxins out of your body! The singing featured on the third and final vocal track, titled "Lion Of Symmetry", is supplied by Toyah Wilcox, whose vocal stylings are eerily similar to those of Jayney Klimek, who can be heard on Banks next two solo side projects - "Bankstatement" (1989) and "Still" (1991). In fact, one of the tracks on "Bankstatement", titled "Queen Of Darkness", contains a similar musical arrangement of one of the subtitled tracks featured on the instrumental "Redwing Suite" - "Lorca" (found here on the "Soundtracks" CD, originally released in 1986 prior to "Bankstatement", which was released three years later), but "QOD" is also supplied by Klimeks rich, ultra-powerful vocals. When you compare and contrast the musical arrangements of both "Final Chase" and "QOD", not only will you note many parallel similarities between the two, you will also notice some subtle musical nuances and differences as well. "Smilin Jack Casey", another instrumental track featured on "Soundtracks", contains many of those same soft and gentle traits, too. Tony Banks would bring many of these same "Banksynths" to the next Genesis project as well, on the bands 1986 album titled "Invisible Touch". If you already have the two Genesis titles mentioned here, you might want to add "Soundtracks" to your Tony Banks/Genesis CD library, because this title is the pefect musical compliment to both "Shapes" and "Invisible Touch". "Soundtracks" is the only TB soundtrack title in print, as well. Make "Soundtracks" your essential purchase today!      ',nonspam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000002GBK	June 28, 2001	14	16	5.0	One of the Most Quintessential British Masterworks!	 Question: What do you get when you combine classical music with a Victorian edge and progressive rock? Why, you get one of the most brilliant pieces of musical geniusness ever put on record! The result is "The Myths and Legends of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table", by one of (progressive) rocks most gifted keyboardists - Rick Wakeman. A rather quaint, well versed British-esque narrative sets the tone of "Arthur" in grand fashion. The rather brief "Lady Of The Lake", the lengthy "Merlin The Magician" and the timely adequate "Sir Galahad, all display the same introductory Victorian choir chant and piano stylings. "Guinevere", "Sir Lancelot And The Black Knight" and "The Last Battle" each display a unique pattern of progressivism, which is a perfect compliment to the Victorian-styled classical music and Shakespearean themes etched throughout this CD. If you like these four titles by Genesis: "Trespass", "Nursery Cryme", "Selling England By The Pound" and "A Trick Of The Tail", then youll most likely enjoy "Myths and Legends..." Of the four above mentioned titles, "Selling England" would make the best companion CD to "Myths", due to its very British lyrical and musical nature. The shock value of "Myths" will be surprising to many Yes fans, because the progressive chords featured on it dont sound anything like the typically progressive instincts provided by Yes, of which Rick Wakeman was a member during the early and late 70s, and also during the early 90s on the groups 91 release "Union". Also, another perfect companion CD to "Myths" would be the Yes solo compilation title "Affirmative: The Yes Solo Family Album", which features two Wakeman tracks, the above mentioned "Merlin The Magician" and "Catherine Howard", with the latter track also featured on another of Ricks solo efforts, titled "The Six Wives Of Henry VIII". "The musical theme of "Catherine Howard" would have fit in with the other songs on "Myths and Legends.." as well. Since it is very rare to hear such exceptional musical genius really shine through on "Myths", by no means should any hardcore fan of progressive rock, or in some cases, classical music, be without this title in their must have CD collection(s).

Three years later, the versatile prog-rockers returned to the studio. The final output resulted in Yes most prolific musical work to date - the marvelously well executed "Going For The One". Perhaps the main element that helped Yes return to its artistic glory, was the return of keyboardist Rick Wakeman, who was the missing piece of the Yes musically dynamic puzzle. The title track definitely sounds like the Yes of old, and starts off the album in high gear. "Turn of the Century" has that classic Yes brand of storytelling written all over it, complete with the opening line: "Realizing (American spelling - sorry!) a form out of stone", which is, archeologically speaking, a lyrical and musical find, as well as moving, to say the least. Both "Parallels" and "Awaken" feature a pastoral sound, courtesy of the church organ featured in both tracks, particularly in the latter selection, where the organ is featured in the middle stanza. "Wondrous Stories" offers much sageful wisdom, which will leave one feeling all the more knowledgeable even after just one listen. Wakemans return was definitely the major boost Yes desperately needed after the so-so "Relayer", but the wonderful Yes wall of sound wouldnt be standing tall much longer, for Rick Wakeman left the band after Yes next release, the very average "Tormato" (1978). If youre a fan of this great progressive group, and you dont have "Going For The One" in your CD collection, all I can say is, "WHAT? ARE YOU NUTS?!!?"      ',spam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000000I0Q	June 22, 2001	1	1	5.0	The first Genesis solo album	 "Voyage of the Acolyte", the first solo offering from a Genesis member, showcases Steve Hacketts unique and immense talents on the guitar quite nicely. The opening track "Ace of Wands", starts things off in grand progressive fashion, although "Ace" is somewhat reminiscent of Emerson, Lake & Palmer, with its encapsulated keyboard rhythms. The pastoral tracks "Hands of the Priestess Parts I & II" have both a mythological and mysterious quality to them, with ""HOTPPI" displaying more of the above qualities. "A Tower Struck Down" displays a unique, artsy progressive charm, in that it features an intricate, fuzzy guitar inerlude in the middle, complete with unanimous bits of chanting in the second half of "Tower". "The Hermit" is very silent, and features Hacketts weak, somewhat cathartic vocals, but its a nice piece of instrumentation, nonetheless. Phil Collins, Steves Genesis bandmate at the time, provides guest vocals on "Star of Sirius", as well as percussive and drumming duties on all the tracks here. Collins and Hacketts intertwined vocals, particularly on the first half of Sirius", sound somewhat muddled, but work well with the fluent progressive vibes displayed here. The brief instrumental "The Lovers" is the calm before the storm of "Shadow of the Hierophant", a wonderfully composed semi-progressive track, which features a lovely choir-like vocal, provided by Mike Oldfields wife Sally. Of all the Genesis related solo projects, "VOTA" has to be in the top five, up there with such gems as Tony Banks "A Curious Feeling" and Mike Rutherfords (who also contributed musically to "Voyage") "Smallcreeps Day". "Voyage of the Acolyte" is truly a Steve Hackett masterpiece, and should not be overlooked by any Genesis fan, or any fan of Progressive Rock, for that matter. Since "Voyage" is the very first solo Genesis CD, it would be wise to add this one to your collection. The gorgeous, stunning artwork on the cover, provided by Steves wife Kim Poor, is yet another reason not to pass this one by.      ',spam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000002J1Q	June 21, 2001	0	1	4.0	WHAT? NO "SUPPERS READY?!!?"	 "Genesis Live", recorded during the groups British leg of the 1972-73 "Foxtrot" tour, features many live musical highlights, many of which sound better than the actual studio recordings. The five outstanding tracks featured here cover Genesis second through fourth albums (Trespass, Nursery Cryme, Foxtrot), which provide the listener with pure maximum musical pleasure with every note played, albeit with only a few very minor musical and lyrical glitches here and there. The opening riffs featured in the first track "Watcher Of The Skies", sound exactly like the studio version, but the pace of this live version is slowed down just a tad as the track progresses, yet picks up again towards the end. The next number, "Get Em Out By Friday", actually sounds better than the studio version, except for one small problem - Peter Gabriels voicing the part of the public address announcer in this live version is voiced rather weakly here, as opposed to his voicing the part in the studio version of "GEOBF", which is carried out with such depth and intensity. "The Return Of The Giant Hogweed", also tastefully done here live, is actually better than the studio version, especially musically, as the instrumentation comes to life in this live version, although the studio versions instrumemtation barely pales in comparison. The same can be said about the live version of "The Musical Box", except Phil Collins background voicing sounds a little off kilter, as wasnt the case in the studio version of this track. The best track on "Genesis Live" is saved for last, however, with the killer "The Knife". The differences between this live version and the original studio version are twofold, in that: One, in the original studio version, the original guitarist (Anthony Phillips) and third drummer (John Mayhew) performed on this track. These two musicians gave "The Knife" a unique musical soundscape with Ants guitar stylings and Mayhews unique rhythmic drumming. But, two, it is on this live version where the above musicians replacements, Steve Hackett and Phil Collins, put their own unique musical stamp on this progressive rock masterpiece. When you hear this live version of "The Knife", it begs the question of whether or not Phillips and Mayhews musical contributions to Genesis are missed that much, especially the former, since Ant Phillips was a major contributor to Genesis sound. Not to take anything away from Steve Hackett, who, by all accounts, is equally as good, if not better, than Ant Phillips was with his mastery of the guitar. The only thing missing from "Genesis Live", however, is perhaps the bands best known composition "Suppers Ready". It would have been nice to have heard how Peter Gabriel wouldve sounded like live on this track. Personally, I think he would have provided more depth vocally to this supposed live version of "Suppers Ready" than the studio version, because, when a band usually performs live, it allows its members to stretch their musical and lyrical wings to the fullest without trying too hard to be perfect. A live version of "Suppers Ready" is featured on the post-Gabriel double live album "Seconds Out", where Phil Collins performs Peters vocal parts with such heart wrenching emotion and with sheer gusto, not just on "Suppers Ready", but on all the Gabriel-oriented tracks featured there. Of course, any die-hard Genesis fan would have to be bonkers if they didnt have BOTH "Seconds Out" AND "Genesis Live" in their must-have CD collection(s). Both titles are techno-audio delights to the ears, and definitely should not be missed by anyone who thoroughly enjoys classic progressive rock. Better grab em while theyre hot!      ',spam

Here, Dave Mason rocks with great musical precision in the cuts "Only You Know And I Know", "Waitin On You" and "Look At You Look At Me". It is on the latter track where Mr. Mason lets loose his interwoven, technically dispalyed guitar virtuosity. "Alone Together" displays a toned-down, moody side as well, which is present in such interpersonal songs as "Cant Stop Worrying, Cant Stop Loving", "Shouldnt Have Took More Than You Gave" and "Sad And Deep As You", all gorgeous and wonderful soul-grabbing numbers to boot. With all its musical glory, the only thing missing on "Alone Together" is the original artwork, and therefore doesnt really deserve to carry MCAs "Compact Disc-Compact Price" generic moniker, as this is among the finest CDs classic rock has to offer. With that said, "AT" seriously is in need of the remaster treatment, although the sound quality featured here isnt all that bad. Since this is Dave Masons first solo effort, I guess one could say he directed "Traffic" quite nicely. "Alone Together" should not be overlooked or missed by any fan of classic rock, Traffic afficianado or not. So, get it, if you havent already!      ',spam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	6303039456	June 7, 2001	0	3	5.0	Not just for kids!	 John Candy stars in a semi-dramatic role as Irv Blitzer, coach of the Jamaican Bobsled Team in "Cool Runnings". Doug E. Doug and Malik Yoba offer fine supporting roles as well, as Blitzers hard to teach pupils about the complex winter sport of bobsledding. In order to pull this feat off, an at first reluctant Coach Blitzer must mold his Jamaican recruits by teaching them the basics of the sport. The results start out rather rockily, for the rugged, tropical Jamaican landscape has absolutely nothing to offer in the form of snow, cold and ice, which would allow these first time bumbling Olympic athletic hopefuls to gain some further insight on how to better prepare themselves for the tough road ahead. The hilly Jamaican terrain would soon serve a purpose here, as the sport of bobsledding requires much agility and speed necessary to navigate the many curves and slopes throughout the course. But, in order for these athletic hopefuls to accomplish their goal, they need to raise money for the trip to Canada and the 1988 Winter Olympic Games. Despite the necessary coddling courtesy of Coach Blitzer, who is unable to borrow the $20.000 from the local Olympic Committee that is needed to send the troops to Calgary. On to Plan B, where our future Olympic hopefuls attempt to raise the money on their own through donations, but are only able to scrape up less than $1000, well short of the money needed for the trip. Plan C turns out to be the charm, as one of the athletes, named Junior, receives a cash loan (obtained by him through a small white lie) from his wealthy father (who wholeheartedly objects to his sons amateurish career choice), plus Junior having to sell his car to cover the remaining cost of the trip. Now, the wheels are set in motion. As soon as the boys and their coach arrive in Calgary, they receive a rather harsh greeting, courtesy of the harsh, bitterly cold winter weather. Sanka Coffie (Doug E. Doug), Yul Brenner (Malik Yoba), Junior Bevil (Rawle D. Lewis) and Derice Bannock (Leon), are having great difficulty in adjusting to their new winter environment, while Coach Blitzer seems to feel at home in the whitewash (he ought to, being that John Candys Canadian! - although in the film hes from the U.S., kinda ironic, huh?). Blitzer sees to it that his boys are not affected by the negative surroundings, not to mention the harsh reception by everyone from the International Olympic Committee to the other athletes. The coach gives the guys a strict training regimen to better prepare them for their qualifying run, which got off to a shaky start, eventually being the laughingstock of the Olympic Games. Well, as they say, practice makes perfect, as Coach Blitzer & Co. are off to try their nighttime practice qualifying run again, this time coming ever so closely to the one minute official qualifying time limit, but fall just short at finishing with a time of one minute, two seconds. The third time would be the charm, however, as the crew finished their final practice run before the real Olympic competition, finishing at under 1 minute (59.46 seconds, to be precise). Now, its on to the real trials, where the Jamaicans come out of the gate slowly and unsurely, thus continually being mocked at by their adversaries. Coach Blitzer is proud of his team, nonetheless, so the guys go out and celebrate their somewhat major accomplishment, as a result of their second Olympic run. Theres still more work to do, however, before the Jamaicans third and final run, which is a must see. Many a viewer of "Cool Runnings", will be both happy and heartbroken upon seeing the spellbinding ending, which will teach chidren a very important life lesson and instill confidence in them at the same time. Adults will like it for many of the same reasons, including the harsh Canadian environs in which "Cool Runnings" was filmed. The warm stylings of the reggae music are also a perfect compliment to both the Jamaican and Canadian environs, as well as to the films soundtrack. With the fact that this is also one of John Candys final films, makes this feature a must see, must buy for the entire family. Dont miss out!      ',spam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	0767825616	June 6, 2001	3	3	5.0	1967: The Year Of Sidney Poitier!	 The year 1967 was one where three subjects were on the minds of many Americans: the hippie revolution, war and predjudicism/racism. The latter is very well documented in the Stanley Kramer directorial epic "Guess Whos Coming To Dinner", in that its subject, interracial relationships, somewhat examines the various types of prejudices people were casting out during that era. The movie begins with an elitist couple, Dr. John Prentice and Joey Drayton (both craftfully played by Oscar nominee Sidney Poitier and Katharine Houghton), who are experiencing a romantic high after meeting on vacation in Hawaii. Tired from the trip, Dr. Prentice wants a little r & r at a hotel, but Joey insists that The Good Doctor meet her upper class parents, so they imediately go to Joeys mothers place of employment, only to find her mother isnt there, then its on to Joeys parents home. Upon Mrs. Draytons (played brilliantly to an Academy award nominated performance by Katharine Hepburn) first glance of Dr. Prentice, she is both shocked and amazed of the prospect that the doctor is black. Much the same is true about Mr. Draytons postion on the situation (also played to an award-winning performance by Spencer Tracy), whos even more shocked and appalled over his daughters relationship with Dr. Prentice than his wife is. The Draytons maid Tillie (played wonderfully by Isabel Sanford [of "The Jeffersons"]) isnt all that crazy about Dr. Prentice, either, and sees him as nothing more than an arrogant, uppity man who enjoys getting what he wants, but thats further from the truth, as Joey sees Dr. Prentice as a kind, wonderful human being whom she wants to marry. As time progresses forward, Mrs. Drayton softens up in her stance concerning the relationship, while Mr. Draytons stance gets even more firm with each passing moment. Note the painstakingly intense expression on Spencer Tracys face during the many scenes of this picture. You can understand why hes been nominated for various awards throughout various points of his career. When Dr. Prentices parents are invited to dinner, it seems that all hell will break loose, as both families continue to analyze the situation further. Even with some trite coddling and persuasion from Mrs. Drayton, she still is not able to sell the mixed marriage idea to her husband. At the same time, Dr. Prentice is having just as much difficulty in getting his father, and in certain instances his mother, to see the benefits of this relatinship. Notice the scene where Dr. Prentice stands up to his father. Sidney Poitiers remarkably intense, emotional acting style is unmistakable here, as he lets loose a temper with such fire and gusto. 1967 was perhaps Sidney Poitiers finest moment in theater, as he starred in three of the hottest movies that year: as the soft and stern scholteacher in "To Sir, With Love", as the convincing Virgil Tibbs in "In The Heat Of The Night" and in "Guess Whos Coming To Dinner", all fine performances, indeed.As tensions continue to surface between both John and Joeys paternal parents, it is up to the Draytons pastoral advisor, Monsignor Ryan, to talk some sense into the disrupted parties. He finally succeeds in the end, as one of the most emotional scenes in the movie occurs, courtesy of Katharine Hepburn. While on the road to Mr. Draytons changing his mind about the marriage proceedings, which he comes to accept, Mrs. Drayton lets out a tear filled display of emotion that only Ms. Hepburn can create, which explains her wealth of fandom, not to mention several Oscar and Academy awards on her mantle throughout her glorious career. As is expected, alls well that ends well, as John and Joey are off to Switzerland for their wedding, which tearfully, we never get to witness. It is because of this fine films theme, including its stunning cast, that makes "Guess Whos Coming To Dinner" worthy of being in any motion picture connoisseurs video library. A must not miss!

' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000002IJ2	June 4, 2001	5	10	4.0	"Invisible Touch" is anything but invisible!	 Ever since my previous review of "Invisible Touch", Ive had to rethink my stance on this technological wonder of sound for a number of reasons. I stated in my last review of this album that it was a little too "techno-popish" to suit my musical tastes, which are quite varied. OK, I know two-thirds of the songs on "Invisible Touch" are overly-synthesized, commercially-oriented pop ballads, but what many Genesis Phil Collins era bashers fail to realize is that while groups in the early 80s, such as Styx and REO Speedwagon, practically invented the power ballad, it took Genesis to reinvent it - thus putting a unique and creative spin on it that only Genesis is capable of creating. This group may have put out several mushy ballads time and again under Collins direction, but the unique and various musical stylings brought forth by Collins, Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks more than make up for these sometimes sappy lyrics. To put it another way, Genesis worst compositions are many, many times better when compared with the musical and lyrical body of several other musical groups best works. In judging the artistic merits of the songs featured on "Invisible Touch", for the most part, this is a well-laid out album throughout many tracks, except there are instances where certain musical influences of certain tracks by the artists are overshadowed. Take, for instance, Mike Rutherfords guitar work on more progressive tracks such as "The Last Domino" and the title track", which is drowned out by Tony Banks up-tempo, hard-driven synthesizer work, and is therefore the only thing that makes "Invisible Touch" invisible, although Banks work is outstanding here, as usual. The nearly nine minute non-single version of "Tonight, Tonight, Tonight" is a real treat to the ears, particularly the instrumental sections. Although many Peter Gabriel-era Genesis fans are usually keen on bashing virtually anything of the Phil Collins-era Genesis, particularly this album, perhaps they should give "Invisible Touch" a few listens, especially "Anything She Does", "The Last Domino" and "The Brazilian". These fans will then come to realize that Genesis didnt completely abandon their progressive roots. Maybe then the Gabrielists will give the Collins era its due, and will take much of the entire Genesis catalogue at "Face Value" (sorry Phil, no pun intended!). While theyre at it, the Gabrielites should also give "...And Then There Were Three...", "Duke", "Dodo/Lurker" from "Abacab" and the self-titled "Genesis" (a.k.a. "Shapes") CDs adequate listens as well, for the progressive tracks on these albums very well stand up to virtually anything from the Gabriel era. Dont get me wrong. I, too, generally prefer the Gabriel-era Genesis over the Phil Collins-era Genesis, most likely because of the early Genesis era musical as well as lyrical stylings. By comparison, "Invisible Touch" seems outdated when compared to todays musical standards, with its 80s synthesizer and electronic drum effects, but thats beside the point when you consider Genesis major contributions to the music industry, which lasted for nearly thirty years. That, combined with the fact that this remarkably talented group of individuals always had a fresh batch of musical ideas in their creative well, no matter who was involved with the group. Even the most die-hard Genesis fan has to wonder whether or not that well will be operative again in the near future. One can only wait and hope. Until then, if you havent had the opportunity to include "Invisible Touch" in your all-important CD collection, you better do it soon before it becomes a missed opportunity at that.      ',nonspam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000002PD0	May 31, 2001	1	1	4.0	"A Single Man" - Singularly Splendid!	 Even though "A Single Man" doesnt quite equal the musical and creative output which Elton John displayed on previous albums, particularly with longtime lyrical partner Bernie Taupin, whos abscence isnt missed all that much here. Even a number of die-hard Elton fans would be inclined to agree with me after listening to this marvelous array of compositions. "Shine On Through" kicks off the album in fine fashion and continues smoothly into "Return To Paradise". Some good disco vibes are well represented with the tracks "I Dont Care", "Part-Time Love" (a minor AM radio hit in 1978) and the pyrotechnically-sound "Madness". "Big Dipper" has sort of a jazzy-swing feel to it, while the rather lengthy "It Aint Gonna Be Easy" is a reverse-tempo, heart-breaky love song. EJ must have an undying love-affair with "The Peachtree State" when he croons, as well as nimblifies his countrified piano stylings in the gospel-like "Georgia". "Shooting Star" somewhat deadens the tone of the CD with its slow, quiet pace, while the final two musical pieces "Reverie" and "Song For Guy" close out "A Single Man" on a strong and positive note. Even though this version is somewhat outdated, the sound quality is very good, even if this disc is played on a smaller stereo CD system. For the Elton John fan who craves for a little more music, theres a recently remastered edition of "A Single Man", complete with bonus tracks, which is definitely worth spending more money for. But, if youd rather not spend a lot of money, this original CD version of "ASM" will do at half the price. The remastered version has made this version obsolete, though. So, you better buy the original version today, before its gone in a heartbeat!      ',nonspam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000002J23	May 23, 2001	2	2	4.0	"Drama" is good from start to finish	 When Jon Anderson and Rick Wakeman left Yes after the bands noticeably better than average 1978 album "Tormato" was released, it would appear to be kaputz, as far as this legendary progressive rock groups musical craftsmanship and output was concerned. Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes (both formerly of the new wave group "The Buggles", who had a hit with "Video Killed The Radio Star", released in 1979. It was also the very first video MTV aired in 1981.) both prove to be able replacements for both Anderson and Wakeman, although Horns vocals dont have quite the zip and charisma that Anderson displayed. As far as Downes keyboard style is concerned, when compared with Wakemans style, Downes seems to rely less on technique and more on rapid-fire playing. This kind of musicianship seems out of place on a Yes recording, but nevertheless, it works on "Drama". The CD begins with a roaring guitar fade in, courtesy of Steve Howe on "Machine Messiah", and continues with foot-stomping vigor throughout the track. Things come to a standstill on the brief and regressive "White Car". Then the progressive embracings return to life on "Does It Really Happen?" The most interesting piece, as well as the best track musically here, a mechanical, musical machine known as "Into The Lens", possibly earns Yes gold star status, complete with a mixture of Steve Howes remarkable guitar and Chris Squires over-the-top bass playing. "Run Through The Light", seems to be a little nonchalant and very overplayed. "Tempus Fugit" closes out "Drama" on a strong note, complete with an answer to Yes! The lyric quality here may not be as strong, as is the case of Yes other albums, but perhaps the strongest track in the Lyrics, Incorporated Dept as far as "Drama" is concerned, would have to go to "Into The Lens", with its overly cliched line "I Am A Camera". But, what makes "Drama" all the more unique, is due to the fact this was Jon Andersons only album on which he did not appear - unique in a way that Jons contributions to the band have always been surprisingly stellar to most Yes fans (including myself). Therefore, he has brought many a good idea to the creative Yes table throughout his long and glamorous career, so its hard to imagine any Yes lineup without him. To many Yes fans, his presence was sorely missed on an album of this style, but not for long, as Yes continued to grow and change in the years ahead, with Jon Anderson back in the fold, including another original member, Tony Kaye. Together, these two revamped Yes with a totally new look, as well as a new sound in the early 80s, although their new sound wouldnt quite match their magnificent early 70s albums. Even die-hard fans of this legendary group, as well as those who are new to Yes music, will find that "Drama" will grow on them after a few listens. So, even if the music still doesnt appease you after a few listens, then please buy it for Yes artist Roger Deans illustrious cover art, which is absolutely breathtaking, and is worth the price of "Drama" alone. Grab this ultimate masterpiece today!      ',nonspam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B0000254MN	May 22, 2001	11	13	5.0	The Todd Rundgren Experiment	 Upon the initial complete first listening of "Something/Anything", perhaps the conclusion you just might come to is that its two albums in one - in that one, it gives you the feel of what a recording session sounds like. Two, with so many different musical styles displayed here, "Something/Anything" sounds like the ultimate concept album, which, in a way, it is. Todd Rundgren puts his all both musically and creatively into this double-CD of songs that range from the sublime ["Wolfman Jack", "It Takes Two To Tango (This Is For The Girls)" and "The Night The Carousel Burnt Down"], to the ridiculous ("Intro", "Saving Grace", [with its bizarre, Satanic-like intro], "Song Of The Viking", "I Went To The Mirror" [with its warped, psychedelic-etched vocalization done by TR], "Piss Aaron" [join Todd as he takes you on a guided tour through high school life, with the adventures of three misguided, aimless lads named "Piss Aaron", "Dumb Larry" and "Chuck Biscuits"] and "Some Folks Is Even Whiter Than Me". If its sensible tunes youre looking for here, dont despair, cause TR aims to please with "I Saw The Light" and "Hello Its Me", both of which made the Billboard Top 20 charts in 1972 and 1973, respectively. Cant get enough of those sensible, heart warming ballads? To wet your appetite, theres "It Wouldnt Have Made Any Difference". This Rundgren composition was also recorded by Canadian singer-songwriter Tom Middleton, whose version of this tune was out at the same time Todds version was. But, unlike Rundgrens original rendition, which didnt chart, Middletons version latched onto the Canadian music charts. "Cold Morning Light", "Sweeter Memories" and "Marlene" are the other somber, heart-achy ballads thatll possibly have you weeping a tear or two as soon as youve finished listening to them. The dialogue that takes place between certain tracks is quite innovative, yet unusual. Speaking of innovations, its a shame TRs patented guitar voice box device (which has been used by the likes of Peter Frampton, among others) isnt featured here, for Todd most likely invented that sometime after "Something/Anything" was released. For those of you looking to discover the unique, highly intellectual sounds of Todd Rundgren for the very first time, but youre not sure where to begin, I would suggest starting with this double-CD masterpiece, since theres an entire potpourri of various musical styles featured here. That should give you all the information you need to know about the man known affectionately as Todd Rundgren, and his music. I would advise that you not wait too long in purchasing "Something/Anything", cause theres only so much physical material made available thats used to manufacture a CD. In other words, nothing in this world lasts forever, so make that all-important purchase today, before its too late!      ',spam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000002QII	May 21, 2001	3	3	4.0	Three Cheers For Bill Cosby - RAH! RAH!! RAH!!!	 If youve ever seen or heard a Bill Cosby production, whether it be at a comedy club, on television, from listening to one of his classic comedy albums, or as a television commercial spokesperson for various products, then youll realize this is a man of many talents. It is due to the mainstay of Mr. Cosbys four decades in the entertainment business, which define his enormous talents and success as an entertainer. Listening to a Bill Cosby comedy album is not only a masterful comical work in progress, but is also an educational experience in and of itself. In "Bill Cosby - At His Best", the master himself will teach you how to say no to persnickety, stubborn children (Froofie The Dog), while tickling your funny bone at the same time. Want to learn how to play "Football" the Cosby way? You can learn all about the sport in Professor Cosbys "COS ELEM FOOTBALL 101". Mr. Cosby will not only provide you with his insight on how to play the sport like a professional klutz, hell also teach you about how to take losing a game with a sense of dignity, as well as with a sense of humor in a way that only Mr. Cosby can deliver! Why is Mr. Cosby qualified to teach this course, you ask? Because he posesses a Doctorate Degree in Education, thats why! Talk about various family members being a handful, Mr. Cosby will give it to you straight (with a twist of that ol Cosby humor, of course!), as he lets the chips fall where they may in "My Brother Russell". The "Dos & Donts" on how to spend a worthwhile vacation in "The Gambling Capitol of America" with your significant other is well laid out as your personal guide to "(In Las Vegas) Be Good To Your Wives". If youre just dying to know "How Fat Albert Got A Hernia", well, youll just have to find out for yourself by listening to this priceless gem. Personally, I would not recommend beating your wife (for those of you who are married)! So, before all you frustrated guys out there get all bent out of shape, I would advise listening to "Why Beat Your Wife". The comical atmosphere will absorb those tense feelings completely out of your body! "Grover Henson Feels Forgotten" seems out of place on a comedy album, due to its musical backdrop set to Bills narration of a letter reading, as written about and as a dedication to Grover Henson (who else?), who is stationed in the military. Grover Henson could also be either an anonymous character, or possibly one of Mr. Cosbys friends whom Bill knew from his childhood. I did not, however, find one speck of comedy in this particular dialogue, which explains why it belongs on a Top 40 countdown show and not on a comedy album. Getting back to the comedy, "The Cos" will examine the ups and downs of married life in "Bills Marriage", so just sit back, take your shoes off, and enjoy. What? You still havent quite gotten your fill from that "Football" class? Well, dont despair, sports minded fan(s). Professor Cosby is teaching a class in Track & Field, titled "COS ELEM TRACK & FIELD 102", aka "Track And Field High Jump". Here, youll learn the basics of this sport and more, as well as have a jollingly, hilariously good time while doing so. Last, but not least, Id like to pay a humble tribute to BCs son, the late Ennis Cosby, as hes the person to whom Bills speaking about in "Ennis Toilet". Youll probably cry as you hear this piece. Ennis wouldnt want you to be sad, so please have a chuckle or two as you listen to "Ennis Toilet", as well as the rest of the skits featured in this comedy CD materpiece in Enniss memory. Thank you, very much. IN LOVING MEMORY...ENNIS COSBY (1970-1997).      ',nonspam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000000XCH	May 21, 2001	1	1	5.0	THE Best "Swamp Rock" Group Of All Time!	 By the time the late 60s/early 70s rolled around, the rock music scene needed a fresher and more uniquely creative sound. There to fill the bill was a group of northern California musicians known as Creedence Clearwater Revival. This group, which featured John Fogerty on vocals and lead guitar, his late brother Tom Fogerty on guitar, Doug Clifford on drums, and Stu Cook on bass guitar, would forever leave their signature stamp on rock music history, and would set a path for other groups to follow, such as the likes of The Allman Brothers Band and Lynyrd Skynyrd. As soon as CCR played their instruments, one knew that a magical, musical sound would emerge from them, a sound which would eventually make CCR world famous from the above mentioned time period, and beyond."Cosmos Factory" doesnt fail to disappoint from the very first note. "Ramble Tamble" gets things started off in progressive, classic swamp rock fashion, then eases into a soulful, bluesy groove with "Before You Accuse Me", a number that has also been recorded by the likes of John Lee Hooker, Eric Clapton, and perhaps others. The tone of the CD is once again jump-started, courtesy of the up-tempo "Travelin Band". John, Tom, Stu, and Doug provide some strong licks on Roy Orbisons "Ooby Dooby". "Lookin Out My Back Door", "Run Through The Jungle" and "Up Around The Bend" perhaps make some hidden, casual statements about the Vietnam war, and theyre fine rockin numbers to boot! Stu Cooks unique over-the-top bass playing, which is heard at the beginning of the melancholic "My Baby Left Me", is the highlight of this particular track, while the whys and wherefores of "Wholl Stop The Rain" will have you pondering, for sure. The ultimate masterpiece on "Cosmos Factory" is the ultra-rockin eleven minute long jam "I Heard It Through The Grapevine". This version gets my vote over both the Gladys Knight and Marvin Gaye versions by a landslide! "Long As I Can See The Light" closes out the CD on a somber note, but is a sensible ballad, nonetheless. If youre planning on taking a tour of "Cosmos Factory", you better do it soon. With a factory pumping out such a great product, it is not destined to last forever, and is sure to shut down production and close up shop any day now. This is one trip you will have been glad to have made!      ',spam

ED & JFC also struck it rich with the following: "Well Never Have To Say Goodbye Again", "Gone Too Far", "Its Sad To Belong" and "Love Is The Answer".

Dan Seals, without the "England", would later find success on the country charts in the mid-80s, both as a solo and as a duet artist with songs such as "Meet Me In Montana" (with Marie Osmond) and "Bop". As for John Ford Coley, last I heard, he was selling used cars in Podunksville, Texas, although I could very well be wrong, which I am! Even though JFC may no longer be involved with the music business today, he sure left behind a lot of good music during his brief partnership with (England) Dan Seals (whose brother is Jim Seals of "Seals & Crofts", who had a plethora of early 70s pop hits as well). "The Very Best Of England Dan & John Ford Coley" is a very suitable and soothing collection of songs for any connoiseur of this style of music to have in their collection(s). But, like all good things, this CD wont be around forever. So you better purchase this priceless gem of must-have songs before it becomes a thing of the past. Buy yours today!      ',spam

One listen to "The Best Of The Oak Ridge Boys - The Millennium Collection" will have you immediately hooked on the material, even if you arent a fan of country music. What endeared many a fan to this legendary quartet is their unique brand of interwoven, finely homogenized blend of vocalization. Perhaps you could call the Oaks the "Mamas and the Papas" or the "Three Dog Night" of country music. In this collection, you get eleven of their best known country tunes, plus the Oaks one and only crossover country-pop smash "Elvira", which features Richard Sterbans trademark bass vocals. I couldnt sing that low if my life depended on it!  The saxophone playing in "Bobbie Sue" is reminiscent of The Coasters "Charlie Brown", which gives this track a jazzy-bluesy sort of quality. My favorite tracks in this collection would have to be "I Wish You Could Have Turned My Head (And Left My Heart Alone)", "American Made" (which was later revamped and used in a  popular beer commercial), "Trying To Love Two Women", "Fancy Free" and "Make My Life With You". The other tracks featured in this greatest hits collection are worth the money as well, so youll derive great listening pleasure, as well as get more than what you pay for with this one of a kind body of work from one of country musics biggest legends. This could be a five star review, had MCA included the Oaks two most endearing favorites "Thank God For Kids" and "Everyday", but MCA sort of dropped the ball on this one. Although The Oak Ridge Boys have enjoyed a rather fruitful career over the years, perhaps their most notorious act was when Joe Bonsall, Duane Allen and Richard Sterban dismissed fellow longtime member William Lee Golden in the mid-80s for refusing to shave off his trademark shepherd-like, salt and pepper beard. Cmon guys, thats like asking Alex Trebek to do away with his "flavor saver", or even asking Kenny Rogers to  shave off all his facial hair! The group then replaced Golden with a dark haired guy with no facial hair, who, in photographs looked so out of place in this band. By the time the 90s rolled around, Golden was later back with The Oak Ridge Boys, but the group failed to recapture their late 70s/early 80s chart success. This Millennium Collection CD belongs in every country music/Oaks fans, and in some cases, pop music fans CD library. You better not wait too long, because "The Best Of The Oak Ridge Boys - The Millennium Collection" might not be around for the next millennium! As they say down South, "Ya better git while the gittins good!" In English, that means "Order yours today (while supplies last)!"      ',nonspam

As soon as you hear the first note of the title track from "People Like Us", youll notice this isnt the same group who recorded such stellar classics as "California Dreamin" and "Monday, Monday" in the peace lovin 60s. Since this CD/album was originally released in 1971, perhaps "The Mamas & The Papas" had to change their sound to keep up with the new decade, even though this, sadly, would be their last album on which they would perform together. This "new" sound can be heard on most of the songs that are featured on "People Like Us". The title track somewhat hearkens back to The Associations "Never My Love". "Pacific Coast Highway" is the perfect musical number for crusing down U.S. 101 (or the H-3, if you live on the island of Oahu). But, beware the "Snowqueen Of Texas", for shell do her best to spoil your pleasant journey by creating a hazardous snowstorm in your path! Even though the famous harmonies that are heard on "The Mamas & The Papas" previous albums arent persent here, they come fairly close in the groovy "Shooting Star". The Caribbean vibes heard in "European Blueboy" dont justify that songs title. Perhaps a more suitable title would be "Jamaican Rastaman" (or something to that effect!). "Pearl" is very satisfying, while "I Wanna Be A Star" showcases Michelle Phillips songwriting capabilities. This is the only song on the entire CD that wasnt written by (the late, great) John Phillips, who also wrote eleven of the twelve songs and produced this uniquely hip and funky array of compositions. If youre looking for a grasshopper to add to your insect collection, but are having great difficulty in catching one, then dont despair. "The Mamas & The Papas" have rounded up their own "Grasshopper", and its yours, just by ordering this one of a kind CD. You say you have "No Dough" (or very little of it, anyway)? No problem! This CD is available at a rather "compact" price. But, you better not wait too long, because soon this "Grasshopper", as well as the rest of the songs featured only here, will soon become extinct. "People Like Us" is the perfect companion with "Blueberries For Breakfast"!      ',nonspam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B0000032ZM	April 27, 2001	11	12	4.0	A treasure trove of memorable late 70s hits	 "Super Hits of the 70s - Have A Nice Day Vol. 21" contains yet more of those 70s power-pop Top 40 tunes youve come to know and love. This collection focuses on the late 70s - specifically late 1977/early 1978. Ram Jams "Black Betty" kicks things off into high gear, with an unmistakable Southern-rock, hard-edged flair. As the Autumn months of 77 rolled around, moviegoers hadnt quite gotten their fill of the box-office mega-flick "Star Wars", which was released in theaters earlier that summer, so a discofied rendition of John Williams original score was released - this version by Meco titled "Star Wars Theme/Cantina Band", which hit the Billboard charts big-time and made it to number one, as well. The Los Angeles-based group Player reaped adequate rewards from their first single titled "Baby Come Back", released during early 78. Players success was short-lived however, and saw just two more singles enter the charts during the course of the year, and disbanded soon afterward. The absolute worst song of all time appears on this collection - Meri Wilsons "Telephone Man". Whoever had the foresight to include this clutter here had to have been on battery acid, as it is just plain horrible and incredibly insipid - which is why "Have A Nice Day Vol. 21 gets four stars instead of five. Now that weve gotten that senseless, moronic "tune" out of the way, let us continue onward. Ex-Spirit and Jo Jo Gunne member Jay Ferguson, who had a hit with the former group and sang lead on the single "Ive Got A Line On You" in the late 60s, contributes here with his only solo chart effort "Thunder Island", released in the Spring of 78. If its wispy, sentimental ballads that you crave, theres Dan Hills "Sometimes When We Touch", a major hit in both the U.S. and Canada also during the Spring of 78. For a howlingly good time, ghouls, ghosts and goblins will have a frightfully good time with Warren Zevons "Werewolves Of London". Moviegoers in the Winter of 77/78 will recognize ex-Bread frontman David Gates "Goodbye Girl" from the movie of the same name, which was released in April of 78 after the motion pictures release. Waless Bonnie Tyler had her first big hit with "Its A Heartache" during the Summer of 78, as well as did Michael Johnson with his hit - the melancholic tear jerker "Bluer Than Blue". Before Exile jumped the pop ship into country music waters, they hit it big with "Kiss You All Over", written by two of the groups members - Mike Chapman and Nicky Chinn, who became songwriters and mega-producers for other artists during the late 70s and early 80s. Finally, to round out this collection of chartbusters, theres Walter Egans top twenty smash "Magnet And Steel", which also features backing vocals courtesy of Fleetwood Macs Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. As far as "Telephone Man" is concerned, I felt Rhino could have utilized better singles for this collection from that era in its place, such as Dolly Partons "Here You Come Again", or Firefalls "Just Remember I Love You" (both released in Autumn of 77), to name a few, although there are several other singles from this time period that could have definitely gotten the nod over "Telephone Man". Even though were stuck with TM, "Have A Nice Day Vol. 21" is still a good arrangement of superbly crafted pop tunes to have in your CD collection at any rate. A must have for completeists of this 25 volume series.      ',nonspam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B0000032RN	March 31, 2001	3	6	4.0	Yet more radio-friendly hits from the 70s!	 "Super Hits of the 70s: Have A Nice Day Vol. 10" features many highlights. The CD kicks off with a nice, sentimental ballad titled "It Never Rains In Southern California", by English singer-songwriter Albert Hammond. This single reached the Top 5 on the U.S. Billboard chart during late 72/early 73, and the songs lyrics express/suggest a melancholic, homesick(ness) feel(ing), but its still an enjoyable number to listen to. If youre into jazz standards recorded in the style of the (nineteen) thirties and forties, theres Hurricane Smiths "Oh Babe, What Would You Say" - a smooth, lusty ballad. Canadian trio Edward Bear saw one of their few entries enter the American charts during the Spring of 73 - "Last Song", but the Bear dropped out of sight soon afterward. Loudon Wainwright IIIs "Dead Skunk" is quite silly, but hits the mark musically, with its hillbilly-styled banjo rhythms. After years of trying, Dr. Hook finally got their picture on "The Cover Of The Rolling Stone" during the Spring of 73, but the residents of a particular state in our great nation mustnt have been taking heed of the major/minor (however you look at it) catastrophe that lie(d) ahead, because during one spring evening, "The Night The Lights Went Out In Georgia" while Georgians were buying some of those Rolling Stone copies. This also turned out to be Vicki Lawrences (of The Carol Burnett Show) only hit single, which went to number one on the Billboard chart during the Spring of 73. The Gerry Rafferty-led Stealers Wheel had a Beatles-styled hit titled "Stuck In The Middle With You" in May of that same year. Also in May of 73, Dobie Gray saw yet another of his few hit singles reach the charts, the soul/r&b/gospel ladened "Drift Away" - a song that suggests the healing power rock & roll has on an individual, even through the most trying times. Legendary rock producer David Foster experienced humble beginnings while a member of the group "Skylark", who had a U.S. Top 10 hit with the erotic "Wildflower". Stories had their only number one hit in August of 73 with "Brother Louie" - a song about an uptight interracial love affair. Looking Glass second single, "Jimmy Loves Mary-Anne", failed to recapture the success of their previous single, the 1972 chart-topper "Brandy (Youre A Fine Girl)", and therefore, only rose to #39 on the Billboard Top 40 chart during the early Fall of 73. Finally, if its the bubblegum sound that you crave, theres the DeFranco Familys "Heartbeat-Its A Lovebeat". This track is a copycat of the Osmonds and the Jackson 5 sound, which is one of the many reasons why I greatly despise it (not that I dont totally hate either The Osmonds or The Jackson 5, its just that Id rather leave both of or either of them than take both of or either of them, more or less), and therefore, is the main reason why "Super Hits of the 70s: Have A Nice Day Vol. 10" gets a four out of five star rating. If youre a fan of early 70s pop/Top 40 music, might I suggest you pick up a copy of this CD, because theres a good chance that it might not be around forever.      ',nonspam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B0000021RH	March 22, 2001	0	1	5.0	Five Stars For "Chicago V"!	 Even though Chicago appeared to be heading toward its commercial phase with "Chicago V", it is still a fine album, nonetheless. The band is still just as tight and creative musically as ever under the eagle eye (and ear) of producer James William Guercio and the bands musically talented personnel. The album kicks off with a Terry Kath revved-up guitar interlude a la "Free Form Guitar" on the opening track "A Hit By Varese". The band harmonizes rather nicely on the barbershop quartet styled track "All Is Well". After a nice blues-tinged number titled "Now That Youve Gone", the guys bare their soul musically in the Robert Lamm penned, socially conscious "Dialogue (Part I)", where the white boys do well in trying to sound black, including Kaths Ray Charles quality vocals. "Dialogue (Part II)" continues with Lamms social consciousness, as stated in the lyrics "We can make it happen", "We can change the world now" and "We can save the children". Sounds a little too generalized, but you get the message. "Dialogue (Part II)" drifts off into a more jazzy direction as opposed to the tight, funky r & b rhythms prevalent in "Dialogue (Part I)", but at least the trademark brassy horns are there. Alls quiet on the urban front in "While The City Sleeps", but, as soon as the horns kick in, its party time! With all the excessively loud decibel levels, as sounded by the brass section in this track, perhaps a more appropriate title would be "Sorry We Awakened You". Ah, but you see, once that magnificent horn section heads into full steam, they just cannot stop! Peter Ceteras echoed vocal effect on the rockin "State Of The Union" is a technological wonder for its time period (1972), and is quite awesome! "Goodbye" and "Alma Mater" round out the album on a rather sad and somber note, but fit the tone of this quasi-commercial array of songs very suitably. Since Robert Lamm wrote all except two songs on here (except "Now That Youve Gone" and "Alma Mater", which were written by the late, great guitar wizard Terry Kath), perhaps an aptly named title would be something like "Robert Lamms Opus" or "The Lions Share Of The Lamm", that is, if youd rather prefer that Chicagos catalog(ue) of titles be named and not numbered. Wait, they did that with "Hot Streets", also affectionately known as "Chicago XII". But, why spoil a good thing? Besides, the numbering system has absolutely worked wonders for this musically innovative institution. Plus, it looks great on an album cover, especially with Roman numerals. Although "Chicago V" is the groups initial foray into the pop music world, its stamp on this "genre" would not be fully cemented until the next few albums, that is, until (around) "Chicago X", when the sappy Cetera ballads began dominating Chicagos musical skyline. It is for that reason that die-hard fans of the bands early music should add "Chicago V" to their must-have CD collection(s), even though it is likely that this title will be in Chicagos catalog(ue) forever. Highly recommended for completists of Chicagos music, as well as for pop music fans, nonetheless.      ',spam

Coming off the heels of both their highly successful "Naturally" and "Golden Bisquits" LPs, comes the equally gold(en) "Harmony". This has got to be one of Three Dog Nights best three albums, along with the aforementioned "Naturally" and "Seven Separate Fools". As you will hear for yourself, "Harmony" doesnt fail to disappoint, for this album contains the hits "Never Been To Spain", as written by the late Hoyt Axton (who was a fishing buddy of TDN member/singer Cory Wells), the environmentally-conscious "The Family Of Man", as co-written by Paul Williams, as well as "An Old Fashioned Love Song", also written by Paul (TDN fans, you must also hear the 45 version of "An Old Fashioned Love Song" from the double-CD "Celebrate" collection, as its something to absolutely die for!). The non-singles featured on "Harmony" are just as good, if not better. The guys let it all hang out on "Jam", while they ease into a soulful groove on a song previously done by the late Marvin Gaye, titled "You". Another Motown legend, Stevie Wonder, contributes a composition of his own titled "Never Dreamed Youd Leave Me In Summer". Talk about one of the most prolific songwriters of our time, as Joni Mitchell adds "Night In The City" to the mix, as well. Even a childhood friend of TDNs Danny Hutton gets into the songwriting act, as a song written by Terry Furlong, titled "My Impersonal Life", somehow finds its way here. Theres a price to be paid for all this wonderful music, as Three Dog Night is found guilty of "overexcessive pleasure", as they commit "Murder In My Heart For The Judge". Ah, but the sentence doesnt last long, for, as an appeal, Chuck Negron recites a magnificent poem to the judge, titled: "Mistakes And Illusions", thus our boys are set free from their so-called "crime". Alas, TDN found "Peace Of Mind" at last! To get yours (Peace Of Mind, that is), just purchase a copy of "Harmony" right now!      ',nonspam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000002KDF	February 28, 2004	0	0	5.0	Richard Pryor will always be "The King of Raunchy Comedy!"!	 The 1974 album "That Niggers Crazy", recorded live in San Francisco, features Richard Pryor at his raunchy, down-and-dirty best. Who else but Richard could capture an audience with off-color subject matter such as the relationship between police officers and African-Americans, winos and junkies, White women & African-American men, etc., etc., etc.? The skit featuring Richard battling his father over curfew issues during Pryors teenage years is sure to hit a home run as well. Although this is an excellent piece of stand-up comedy done to perfection during Pryors earlier years, somethings missing. What would be even more perfect, is if this comedy masterwork received the remaster treatment, and on CD (I believe this title and Richards follow-up comedic masterpiece "Bicentennial Nigger" are the only two titles which havent been released on compact disc - although I could be wrong)! Although Richard Pryor unanimously and rightfully deserves the title as "The King of Raunchy Comedy (!)", Eddie Murphy comes in an extremely close second (even though Murphy no longer performs in stand-up circles). As for Eddies influence as a comedian, one amazon.com reviewer said it best, that Murphy "did not steal from, but lovingly borrowed" from (the great) Richard Pryor. How true! With those thoughts in mind, make sure you add "That Niggers Crazy" to your comedy library before Warner/Reprise decides to take it out of print. With laughs this huge, you definitely dont want to be without a copy!      ',spam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000056707	March 13, 2001	8	9	5.0	Im hoping that the title of this CD is a misprint!	 Correct me if Im wrong, but isnt the correct title of this CD "Three Dog Night", or simply "One"? Anyway, this is TDNs first album, and it contains many treasured gems, such as the Dogs first top ten hit single, titled "One", as written by the late Harry Nilsson. But wait, theres more. Also included on this, TDNs first effort, is the upbeat rocker "Heaven Is In Your Mind", which was previously covered by Traffic, as well as the Robbie Robertson penned "Chest Fever", which (I believe) was also covered by Robbies group, The Band, on their "Music From Big Pink" album. Let Brother Cory Wells move your soul with the gospel-like uplifting "Try A Little Tenderness" is sure to provide you. To hear Dannys, Chucks and Corys three-part harmonies really come to life, I recommend you listen to the choice cuts "Its For You" and "Let Me Go", for theyre sure to win your approval. Cory Wells also bares his soul in the bluesy "Bet No One Ever Hurt This Bad", as written by Randy Newman. You say youre feelin down and lonely? The guys recommend you "Find Someone To Love". I mean, "Nobody" should have to go through such an ordeal. Danny, Chuck and Cory also suggest that you "Dont Make Promises" you cant keep! By the way, Neil Young contributes a composition here as well, titled "The Loner". Three Dog Night would eventually earn their place in rock n roll history from this point forward, as they will have amassed twenty-one Top 40 singles, eleven top ten hits, three number ones, as well as an impressive twelve gold albums by 1975. Their record sales to date are an approximate ninety million units sold, which is an enormous feat in and of itself. "Three Dog Night" or "One", is no longer available in the U.S., and is only sold as an import title. Better grab it soon, because its the only "One" of its kind left.

' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000002QX0	March 10, 2001	10	10	5.0	These Dogs Dont Need Leashes!	 "Seven Separate Fools" rivals "Naturally" as one of Three Dog Nights best albums in many ways. Need proof? Well, like "Naturally", "SSF" features many different musical styles. For instance, if youre into rock n roll with some bite, theres "Chained" and "The Writings On The Wall". In "Tulsa Turnaround", the band appears to have their geography a little mixed up, as a line in the song is mentioned as follows: "Omaha honey had a hold on a hell of a thing" (or something to that effect!). I think the band meant to say "Oklahoma", since thats where Tulsa is located. TDN probably felt that "Oklahoma" didnt fit into the rhythm of the music, so they used the shorter "Omaha", which fit rather nicely. The band more than made up for their geographic error in "Tulsa", with one of the coolest lines in rock n roll history: "When A Mans Gonna Eat Fried Chicken, Hes Gonna Get Greasy!". Jimmy Greenspoons beautiful, flowery keyboard playing on the lone instrumental, titled "Prelude To Morning", is a perfect segue for the sentimental ballad "Pieces Of April", and is sure to bring a tear to your eye. Chuck Negron proves hes two singers in one here, as his high-pitched vocals featured on songs from this CD such as "Chained" and "Freedom For The Stallion" are of sharp contrast to his powerful, rough-edged vocals, as featured on "Midnight Runaway", a song about a rock n roll star on the road whos trapped by his own fame. A Hatfield & McCoys theme is present in "My Old Kentucky Home (Turpentine And Dandelion Wine)", and "In Bed" features a catchy, laid back beat. If youre into movie music, theres "Going In Circles". This track was featured in the motion picture "X,Y&Z", which starred Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. TDNs third and final number one hit, titled "Black And White", is also featured in this fine body of musical work(s). "Black And White" was also a hit for the British reggae group Greyhound, whose version charted a year before TDNs smash single was released. For gospel music lovers, theres an absolutely beautiful balled titled "Freedom For The Stallion", which was also covered by the soul/r&b group The Hues Corporation. As noted here, "SSF" doesnt contain as many hit singles as "Naturally", but thats beside the point when you weigh both albums musical merits, which are equal. Released in 1972, "Seven Separate Fools" was/is one of TDNs greatest achievements musically, and was/is way ahead of its time. It is highly advisable for fans of Three Dog Night to include this title in their CD collection(s) before it goes out of print. At this reduced price, its a sure sign it wont be around forever. Dont be a "fool". Buy "Seven Separate Fools" today. Youll be glad you made this purchase!      ',spam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000002OQV	March 3, 2001	5	5	5.0	Theres so much to "Celebrate" here!	 With "Celebrate: The Three Dog Night Story 1965-1975", there are so many hidden gems just waiting to be (re)-discovered, such as the pre-Dog Night hits and remixes of various TDN hits. Danny Hutton had a minor hit single with the song "Roses And Rainbows", while employed with Hanna-Barbera Productions (the cartoon company), where he was hired as a staff writer/producer as well as providing the voices of various cartoon characters. Hutton later had another minor hit on the MGM label titled "Funny How Love Can Be", an oompah-like, sugary-sappy love song. Cory Wells also had some minor pre-Dog Night success as a member of a Beatles-clone group known as "The Enemys". Featured in this mega-double CD collection is their track "Sinner Man", a hauntingly chilling musical number. Around the same time, The Enemys appeared on an episode of "The Beverly Hillbillies". Shortly after their rather brief appearance on that sitcom, The Enemys disbanded, and Wells formed The Cory Wells Blues Band, of which future TDN bassist Joe Schermie was also a member. About a year later, around 1967, Danny Hutton envisioned an idea of putting together a rather unique, seven piece rock group, where there would be three lead singers backed up by four competent and talented musicians. Each of the three lead singers would take turns singing lead (usually on the same song), which made for the most utterly-unique three-part harmonies, perhaps in the history of rock n roll. Thus, Redwood was born. Redwood was actually the brainchild of The Beach Boys Brian Wilson, who was a friend of Huttons, and was comprised of Danny Hutton, Cory Wells, and now Chuck Negron (whom Danny met through mutual friends) on vocals. Redwood recorded two singles, "Time To Get Alone" and "Darlin", with the former track appearing on the "Celebrate" collection. You will hear Dannys, Chucks and Corys three-part harmonies really shine and are quite exceptional on "Time To Get Alone". Redwood soon disbanded shortly thereafter, due to being caught in the middle of a family feud with The Beach Boys record label. The trio of Hutton, Negron and Wells never looked back from this point on, as they began to sow the seeds of what would eventually become Three Dog Night. The trio hired bassist Joe Schermie, keyboardist Jimmy Greenspoon and an unknown guitarist and drummer, although Michael Allsup and Floyd Sneed would join immediately after the group recorded a previously unreleased demo titled "If You Knew", which was the first song the new aggregation of TDN (sans Michael and Floyd) recorded. Michael and Floyd were not part of "the real TDN" until "Nobody" from the first TDN album was released as a single. As the rest of the story goes, Three Dog Night scored an impressive twenty-one Top 40 hits between 1969 and 1975, including eleven top ten hits and three number one hits. What makes "Celebrate" such a unique collection, is not only do you get the five above mentioned pre-Dog Night songs, you also get some unique singles remixes along with their other hits, including some album tracks as well. Featured remixes are as follows: "Try A Little Tenderness", "Elis Coming", "Joy To The World", "Liar", "An Old Fashioned Love Song", "The Family Of Man" and "Sure As Im Sittin Here". I guess I could give everything away musically as to what each of these remixes entail(s), but Id rather not do that. Instead, youll just have to hear them for yourself. Also, as added bonuses, youll get the previously unreleased, silly "Our "B" Side", and TDNs final Top 40 hit "Til The World Ends", which can only be found in this one-of-a-kind, double-CD collection of TDNs most loved songs...and then some. With all this great music to choose from, "Celebrate: The Three Dog Night Story 1965-1975" is destined to become a collectors item. Buy it now, before MCA takes it out of print.      ',nonspam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B00004XSVL	February 22, 2001	9	9	4.0	Pre Clayton-Thomas effort worth a listen...or two	 "Child Is Father To The Man", Blood, Sweat & Tears first album, delves into the bands flirtation with jazz and rock influences. When B,S&T combines both musical styles into one, it is pure, unaulterated sheer magic. "CIFTTM" does not fail to disappoint, as lead singer Al Koopers vocals homogenize rather nicely with the avant jazzy rock rhythms. Mr. Koopers most noteworthy vocal stylings can be heard in the tracks "I Love You More Than Youll Ever Know", "My Days Are Numbered" and "I Cant Quit Her". Al also bares his soul in the tracks "Just One Smile" and "So Much Love". Steve Katz also contributes a few lead vocals on this freshman effort as well, which are featured in the tracks "Morning Glory" and "Meagans Gypsy Eyes". It is on the former selection where certain chords from this track would eventually be lent to B,S&Ts first hit in the David Clayton-Thomas era: "Youve Made Me So Very Happy", from the bands second album. The latter track features hints of the psychedelic-rock era. It is obvious B,S&T had to keep up with the times, so they included a psychedelic selection here. The band seems to be enjoying themselves in the free-for-all-like romp provided in "House In The Country", while they seem to be getting down to brass tacks in the intellectually charming "The Modern Adventures Of Plato, Diogenes And Freud". B,S&T invites you to attend "Club Jazz" for a rambling rendition of "Without Her", as provided by the delightfully talented Al Kooper (formerly of The Blues Project, along with Steve Katz). Now, did you think for one moment B,S&T took this entire project seriously? You wont think likewise when you hear the group clown around in "Overture", where theres definitely "Somethin Goin On" with all that maniacal laughter! Thats something the Clayton-Thomas era B,S&T wouldnt put up with, as that group made entertainingly serious, in your face music. Had it not been for "Child Is Father To The Man" (which is quite comparable to anything in the DCT era), however, B,S&T might not have gotten off the ground. Due to creative differences with the other bandmates, Al Kooper and a few other members left B,S&T immediately after this album (although Kooper would later return  as a consultant on "B,S&T 4"). Many fans knew what happened next in the DCT era of B,S&T, so no explanation is necessary, other than a few personnel changes, as mentioned above. Due to the fact that Al Kooper played a large part in developing B,S&Ts sound and success, by no means should any hardcore fan of this group exclude "CIFTTM" from their CD library. Buy it now before it becomes a part of history.      ',nonspam

This particular journey starts out rather calmly on the title track, then the Larks descend on their prey with a fury of fire as the track progresses. "Book of Saturday" is a nice, overly sentimental number, while "Exiles" is a track that features rather schizoid musical tendencies, in that the guitar has a mind of its own. The crown jewel here is the comical "Easy Money", complete with a morbid sense of humor and maniacal laugh at the end. Just what in blue blazes are "moccasin sneakers" anyway? "The Talking Drum" is somewhat of a misnomer, yet is very free-flowing with its odd bass and percussive rhythms. The Larks appeared to have awoken from their long hibernation in "Larks Tongues In Aspic, Part Two", and return with that same fury of fire as in the beginning. Hmm...I guess those Larks are/were still hungry. If you have an enormous appetite for King Crimsons music, you better grab these "Larks" before they migrate south for the winter, permanently!

Killed in the crash were lead singer Ronnie Van Zant, guitarist Steve Gaines, backing vocalist Cassie Gaines and road manager Dean Kilpatrick. The other members were seriously injured, but eventually recovered. "Street Survivors" would eventually serve as a fitting tribute to the original lineups music, and what a true last stand of a Southern rock gem it is, with delightful tracks such as "Whats Your Name", "You Got That Right" and "That Smell", a tune that takes a rather obscure look at drug and alcohol abuse. Skynyrds true Southern rock roots shine in "One More Time", while the other tracks keep the CD flowing through quite nicely. The CD also features both album covers: one on the front of the booklet showing the original cover with all seven members engulfed in flames, and the all black memorial cover with all seven members on the back of the booklet and on the CDs back cover. Since "Street Survivors" is the last "real pure" Lynyrd Skynyrd album, die-hard fans of this group will want to add this title to their must-have collection(s), nontheless.      ',spam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000002O06	January 7, 2001	3	3	5.0	The epitome of classic Southern Rock	 There are so many great songs from "Second Helping", Lynyrd Skynyrds sophomore album, that its extremely difficult to pick a favorite. "Sweet Home Alabama" is sweetly scintillating with its opening guitar riff. "Call Me The Breeze" will take you on the ultimate rock n roll ride of a lifetime with Southern references like "I Dig You Georgia Peaches". "The Needle And The Spoon" somewhat delves into the bands experimentation with various drugs, yet is still a hard-rocking, enjoyable number, as are all the songs on the album. "Workin For MCA" is perhaps the first song with a record label in its title. MCA is also the label which Skynyrd recorded for throughout much of the bands heyday in the 70s and early eighties when the already disbanded Skynyrd split ranks and reformed as "The Rossington-Collins Band". The most touching song from "Second Helping" is "The Ballad Of Curtis Loew", a blues-tinged number that tells the story of a blues legend from the Old South (not the Confederate South!) who played strictly for the love of (his) music. "Dont Ask Me No Questions" is also one of the top selections here. With so many good songs to choose from, youll be back for third and fourth helpings! With the fact that "Second Helping" was also produced by blues master Al Kooper, this makes this Southern-rock masterpiece a must buy for any Skynyrd and Al Kooper fan!      ',spam

Americas presence was heard and felt on U.S. AM Top 40 radio stations throughout much of the above mentioned decade.

If "America-History Greatest Hits" isnt enough to satisfy your craving for this groups music, theres an anthology CD titled "Hourglass", which chronicles Americas 25 years in the music business at the time, but I dont know if its still in print. "History" is still a rather suitable collection for those who are looking for a body of this groups musical work. Since there arent many titles available in Americas catalog, you will be wise to add "History" to your CD/Cassette collection!      ',nonspam

With the first five tracks on "Chicago VII" being instrumentals, they compliment the vocal tracks quite nicely. The instrumentals here are mostly jazz-laden, with "Prelude To Aire" and "Aire" opening the set rather nicely. "Devils Sweet" is a very sweet and blissful piece of work, and "Italian From New York" sounds very high-tech for the era, with its computer-generated synthesized sounds featured at the opening and closing of the track. The horns then go into high gear on the closing instrumental "Hanky Panky", with guitar and horns interspersed throughout. The bouncy "Life Saver" is the perfect vocal lead-in, while the other vocal tracks on this CD reflect on personal issues, as evident in the Top 40 hits "(Ive Been) Searching So Long" and "Call On Me". The Beach Boys sing backing vocals on the interpersonal "Wishing You Were Here". This CD also features a bit of a folk sound in the Peter Cetera penned "Happy Man" and in Terry Kaths "Byblos", as well as in "Song Of The Evergreens", complete with an up-tempo, rousing finish. Signs of the disco era are starting to blossom in "Woman Dont Want To Love Me", another Cetera-penned number. The band lets it all hang out in the fiesta-like "Mongonucleosis". Robert Lamm even contributes with a composition of his own, titled "Skinny Boy", including backing vocals from The Ponter Sisters. "Skinny Boy" also appears on Lamms solo album of the same name. It is the plethora of music styles, not to mention those world-famous horns, that make "Chicago VII" a success and a must-buy for any fan of Chicagos music.      ',spam

Nonetheless, there are some very well-polished selections here, as in the opening track "No Opportunity Necessary, No Experience Needed", which sort-of displays a bit of that progressivism the band would be noted for in the near future. Other tracks, such as "Then", "Sweet Dreams" and "Astral Traveller" continue to display that hard-line progressive-rock feel, as well as in the instrumental "The Prophet". The other tracks with the classic-rock sound, such as "Everydays" and the title track, have wonderfully-written lyrics, but sort of miss the mark musically. The string arrangement featured in the title track, although a nice touch, seems out of place in a Yes song, dontcha think? The weakest track on this CD is quite possibly "Clear Days", for some unknown reason. The first change in Yes personnel would soon take place after this album, as Peter Banks would depart from the group, and the groups musical portfolio would be more dimensional with Banks replacement of Steve Howe. Even though "Time And A Word" has a few minor musical glitches (such as the strings), it is a CD even the most die-hard Yes fan would love to have in their collection.      ',nonspam

There is a misprint on the packaging of the track "Dialogue-Parts I & II", although only the second part featuring the horns is heard. This collection has a melancholy feel to it in the songs "No Tell Lover" and "Alive Again" (even though this particular number is up-tempo) because of the fact Terry Kath tragically died before these two songs were recorded. Peter Cetera has the lions share of the vocals here in this collection, which are heard in the very carefree "Happy Man" and "Baby What A Big Surprise", among others. "Old Days" will have you yearning for those days of yore, as will "Take Me Back To Chicago" (that is, unless youre from the "Windy City"), which features Chaka Khan on background vocals. One of the first songs that began Chicagos associated trend with ballads (many on which Cetera sang lead) is the bittersweet "If You Leave Me Now", and is one of the few Chicago songs that doesnt feature the trademark horn section (from this era, anyway), as is also the case with the up-tempo rocker "Gone Long Gone". For a heavy dose on the horns, theres "Questions 67 And 68", although the ironic thing is that this song is from Chicagos very first album, several years before the initial release of "Greatest Hits-Volume 2". It seems that with each passing greatest hits album, from Vol. 1 to Vol. 2 to Vol. 3, there are fewer songs featuring the original three lead vocalists, from the late Terry Kath to Robert Lamm to Peter Cetera, which seems appropriate due to a change in the bands personnel through the years. With over 30+ years in the music business, Chicago shows no signs of slowing down or pondering retirement, which is a testament of a great band. Since "Chicago Greatest Hits-Volume 2" is the last major hits collection of this stellar group, fans of Chicago, young and old, will want to add it to their must have collection.      ',nonspam

"Chicago IX-Greatest Hits" features 11 songs the band recorded from the early to mid-seventies, and every song featured here is a classic. You get Chicagos first major radio hits "Make Me Smile" and "25 Or 6 To 4". Melancholic ballads can also be found in "Wishing You Were Here" and "(Ive Been) Searching So Long", although the fiesta-like horns feel found in "Call On Me" can also be classified as a ballad, as is "Colour My World". Please, by all means, have a rockin good time with "Saturday In The Park" and "Feelin Stronger Every Day". No need to be time-conscious with "Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?". "Beginnings" is a rather fine tune as well, but the AM radio version heard here is not as good, considering the horns fade out at the end before the band is heard chanting. "Just You N Me" has that "relax in the park" type of feel. Much of the lead vocal tracks here were supplied by the late, great Terry Kath, who is sorely missed in the music industry, even almost 23 years after his death. Because of the fact "Chicago IX-Greatest Hits" has the roman numeral title in it, fans of Chicago will want to add it to their collection all the moreso.      ',nonspam

Bounty hunter Jack Walsh (De Niro) is in pursuit of a hypochondriac-type accountant named Jonathan Mardukas (Grodin), whom Walsh gains custody and must return Mardukas from New York to L.A. in order to collect a $100,000 reward. The two men encounter intrigue and danger on this journey, and switch to various modes of transportation to keep the F.B.I. off their trail. Although the writers of the script tried to make this picture into a comedy, the action and suspense overshadow the few comedy scenes, so they (the comedy scenes) dont come out too good in the wash. Even though the intrigue keeps "Midnight Run" moving at a rather slow pace, theres somewhat of a climactic build-up toward the end that may keep you on the edge of your seat. De Niros straight character combined with Grodins introverted comedy character give the films script an even balance, although in various scenes Grodins character proves to be just as straight as De Niros. If you like your movies with an overabundant "cops and robbers" feel, then "Midnight Run" will suit you just fine. Add it to your must-have video library!      ',nonspam

Some of Ric Ocaseks Cars mates help him out on his second solo release, although Ocasek breathes a somewhat different life in a few of the songs here. Take, for instance, "Emotion In Motion", with its slowed-down rhythms and unique lyrics, which dont sound like the typical Cars record. The same can be said for the title track, along with "Emotion In Motion". which lack the new wave appeal and sound The Cars helped define. The other tracks, such as "Hello Darkness" and "p.f.j.", have that Cars sensibility written all over them. Even though the music and songs featured on this CD are very similar to that of Ocaseks group, The Cars, "This Side Of Paradise" is still an enjoyable CD to listen to. The reduced price is a sure sign it wont be around forever, which is why any die-hard Cars/Ric Ocasek fan should have this title in their collection.      ',nonspam

It is on "Fragile" where we are exposed to the classic Yes lineup and sound featured on the above two tracks, as well as in meticulously composed arrangements like "Cans And Brahms", which shows off the bands penchant for classical music, as well as in Chris Squires offbeat, syncopated bass rhythms heard in the brief "Five Per Cent For Nothing". Repetetiveness is the operative key heard in the line "Tell The Moon Or Tell The Marcher", which is the main line along with the sometime repeated title in "We Have Heaven". The tone is then set for the chilly, then progressively rocking vibes in "South Side Of The Sky". Yes progressive-rock roots begin to take shape in "The Fish". while "Mood For A Day" and the first half of "Heart Of The Sunrise" slow down the pace of the CD in general, but is finally relieved by the rollicking finish in the latter half of "Sunrise". New member Rick Wakemans musicianship and style of play put "Fragile" in the proper musical perspective. This is one CD to add to your collection!      ',spam

"Caddyshack" has to be among the top ten funniest films of all time for a number of reasons. #1) The supporting cast. Although not overtly funny, both Chevy Chase and Ted Knight play straight men to two funny comedians: Chases character to Bill Murrays wacky, doped-out greenskeeper character. An example here is during the scene when Chase is visiting Murrays residential quarters, and Murray offers Chase a place to sit and relax, and Chase says: "No thanks, I dont want to stick to anything". Knight and Rodney "I get no respect" Dangerfield have some classic exchanges throughout the movie as well. Youll have to hear them for yourself.  #2) Dangerfield is a class act all by himself in "Caddyshack". With comical lines like "Last time I saw a mouth like that, it had a hook in it", "Now I know why tigers eat their young", "Hey toots, howd you like to earn ten dollars the hard way" and many others, its easy to see why Dangerfield became a mega-superstar soon after "Caddyshack" was released. #3) Theres also the Baby Ruth bar in the swimming pool bit, which is a must see. If you ask me, the Rodney Dangerfield barbs are alone worth the price of this classic film. Kenny Loggins smash hit "Im Alright" is a perfect mini-soundtrack for the movie. As an added bonus, there is a trailer before the movie. Youll hear from the stars themselves talk about the making of "Caddyshack" as well as personal moments and their memories in making this comedy masterpiece. This movie shows no sign of wear and tear, and doesnt appear to be dated, even after a little more than twenty years! Since "Caddyshack-19th Anniversary Edition" is a rare collectors item, you may want to purchase it before its a part of history!      ',spam

Robert Carlyle (The Full Monty) stars as Scottish soccer player Nick Cameron, who, when just upon reaching the apex of his full athletic potential, is suddenly and gradually stricken with Multiple Sclerosis. As Nicks physical condition worsens, it is up to his girlfriend Karen (Juliet Aubrey) to help Nick see his way through his difficult struggle. Karen is urged at the hands of her best friend to leave Nick, but she (Karen) feels she needs to be around him to be of help and for added companionship. At the same time, Karen feels she is missing out sexually, so she is seeing someone else in the meantime to satisfy her needs in this department. Still, she feels Nick needs her, who, because he feels that Karen feels sorry for him, Nick urges her to leave him, but she refuses.

"The Yes Album" is the bands first insight into the realm of progressive rock, and they make good use of the genre in the tracks "Yours Is No Disgrace" and "Starship Trooper", especially in the rousing, hard-line finish provided in the suite c "Wurm". Much sageful wisdom is found in "Ive Seen All Good People", with the majority of those sageful lyrics contained in the suite a "Your Move", and an oft-repetitive nature contained in the suite b "All Good People". Just when the progressivism of "The Yes Album" is being jump-started, the rhythm of the CD is slowed down considerably with "A Venture", but is revived somewhat through the nonchalant embracings of "Perpetual Change". Although the band is learning its craft quite nicely, it would take their next effort for Yes to achieve their full potential in the world of progressive rock. "The Yes Album" would be Tony Kayes last album with the group (although he would rejoin several years later). His place would be taken by the equally talented Rick Wakeman. For the avid listener looking to get an insight into the bands progressive-rock roots, or if you just need an art-rock fixation, look no further than "The Yes Album", a CD thats sure to please even the most discriminate music fan and Yes fan alike.

It is extremely rare to use the words "Eddie Murphy" and "clean" in the same sentence, which ring true in "Saturday Night Live-The Best Of Eddie Murphy". After watching Murphy convey such a unique and endearing comical warmth in which he brings to many of his SNL characters, especially in this video, it makes you wonder why Murphy resorts to using rather obscene language and risque adult themes prevalent in many of his stand-up comedy videos, such as "Eddie Murphy:Raw" and "Delirious", which are highly recommended for laughs, even though these are not satisfactory for young audiences to view. If Mr. Murphy cleaned up his act in the language department, hed still be just as hilarious. On the other hand, if the adult themes and language were excluded entirely, the routines wouldnt be as interesting and much of their viewer appeal would be lost. No need to worry with "The Best Of Eddie Murphy-Saturday Night Live". Its "G" rating means that its a video the whole family can watch together, although there is a slight possibility that the ethnicity present in certain skits may offend certain people, so its best to watch this with an open mind and just laugh out loud! The only thing I dislike about this version is due to the fact there are two different skits, one that replaced the jazz skit where Murphy portrays a "Thelonius Monk"-type musician, sporting a clear plastic mask, which I found quite hilarious! Instead theres a drone skit with Eddie dressed up as Gumby, saying the oft-used phrase "Im Gumby, Dammit!" Somebody please gag me with a spoon! Another skit featured here that wasnt in the original video was a different second skit of "Mister Robinsons Neighborhood" featuring Mr. T. Even though I dont remember the original second skit that was in the original video, I would say the Mr. T skit is/was as equally as funny. The most hilarious skit of the bunch here is definitely the "Jesse Jackson" skit. Youll have to check that one out for yourself! You rarely see any clean, wholesome and comical productions starring Eddie Murphy that are out there, which is why it is necessary to include "The Best Of Eddie Murphy-Saturday Night Live" in your comedy video library.

' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000002IP1	December 13, 2000	4	6	5.0	Phil Collins Finest Solo Moment	 "But Seriously..." is definitely Phil Collins best solo album, and features good pop-music material in songs like "Do You Remember?", "I Wish It Would Rain Down", "Something Happened On The Way To Heaven", "Heat On The Street" and "Another Day In Paradise", with the latter track emphasizing PCs humanitarian side in aiding the homeless. This side of Phil is also heard in "Colours", which deals with the famine in Africa. In fact, during Collins 1990 American Tour, which was sponsored by Sears, he donated a portion of the proceeds from his concerts to agencies and charities that support the homeless. There are also some positive, feel-good vibes generated in "Hang In Long Enough" and in the jazzy "Saturday Night And Sunday Morning". You will find much thought-provoking insight displayed in the tracks "Thats Just The Way It Is" and "Find A Way To My Heart", with its zenith, space-age-like opening and closing. Equally touching is the heartfelt joy and melancholy side found in "Father To Son". An added bonus to this CD are the wonderful musical talents of David Crosby, who sings backing vocals on "Paradise", and provides some guitar work on the CD as well, and Stephen Bishop, who also sings backing vocals on this CD, as well as on other Phil Collins albums/CDs. Bishop also sang on his own hit songs "On And On", "Save It For A Rainy Day" and "It Might Be You", from the motion picture "Tootsie" starring Dustin Hoffman. "But Seriously..." is a socially conscious statement in and of itself, which makes it a must-have CD. Phil Collins would re-emerge two years later with Genesis, with what would appear to be his final album with that legendary rock group. He left Genesis in 1996 after a quarter of a century with the group. But, according to the latest news out of the Genesis camp, PC has apparently re-joined with Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford. What would be even better is if Peter Gabriel and Steve Hackett joined them and harkened back to the "original" classic Genesis lineup. Oh, would that just make my day! Lets keep our fingers crossed, and hope all this comes to fruition. Stay Tuned!      ',spam

Many of the tracks on this CD display the obvious signature 3/4 time changes evident in early Yes recordings of that era. With "Fish Out Of Water", Squire seems to be in a league of his own, and utilizes his creative energies to their fullest effect. The supreme track here is the progressive-blues tinged "Lucky Seven", with its oft-repetitive bass-keyboard rift and that Pink Floyd-ish alto saxophone featured throughout the track. "Hold Out Your Hand" and "You By My Side" are wonderfully composed tracks as well. "Silently Falling" is rather engulfed with those spiraling signature time changes, in the second half, anyway, then fades out with a symphonic fury of fire. The same can be said for the second half of the 15-minute long "Safe (Canon Song)", with its repetitive thumping bass- playing mixed with orchestral arrangements. I think youll agree with me that this is the best of the Yes solo projects, bar none, although Rick Wakemans solo projects are nothing to sneeze at, either. "Fish Out Of Water" still sounds as fresh and musical as it probably did 25 years ago. As to the mystery of why Chris Squire hasnt recorded another solo album in all these years, I havent the foggiest idea, as the British would say. This CD is another of those rare gems just begging to be re-discovered. Its a shame "Fish Out Of Water" isnt available as a domestic title.

But, nonetheless, this is one of those romantic love stories with a touch of comedy and a whole lot of drama, like a soap opera, but only better. The plot centers around a consultant of an architectural firm, Alex (Matthew Perry), who, by fate, meets a single Mexican woman named Isabel (Salma Hayek). After spending the night together, Isabel becomes pregnant with Alexs child, but is quite shocked about the news at first, and isnt sure whether or not she wants to continue their relationship. As time progresses, the couple get to know each other better and Isabel introduces Alex to her family, the Fuenteses (including an angry chihuahua named Che, who, at first, displays an intense dislike for Alex, but softens up to him later), and, likewise, Isabel later meets Alexs parents. At first, their parents dont agree with the idea of Alex and Isabel going steady, because of the cultural differences of both families. But what the heck, it all makes for a very interesting, and rather potent, love story. In fact, it is a love story (as mentioned above)! Rather than saying anything further, I suggest you pick up a copy of "Fools Rush In". The chihuahua alone is worth the price of this movie!

With "Tennessee Moon", ND takes a full-blown journey into country music. Quite a few of the songs on this CD feature a bit of that new country sound, a la Shania Twain and Faith Hill. The first, third and fourth songs are recorded in that very style, as well as some others.Theres a bit of that classic country sound featured in "One Good Love", a duet with the legendary Waylon Jennings, and in "Blue Highway", where Neil teams up musically with guitar impresario Chet Atkins. The only thing concerning the entire tone of "Tennessee Moon" is that parts of it emit a "schizophrenic" mood, in that when certain songs go from up-tempo numbers to melancholy, subtle numbers, it throws the CD slightly out of kilter, therefore leaving one in a depressed state of mind. Thats not the case in going from flat, listless numbers to rockin up-tempo numbers, then youre floating on cloud nine again. A song featured here thatll have you living on that cloud permanently is "Talking Optimist Blues (Good Day Today)", in which Neil is speaking of the "downtroddenness" we all experience from time to time (ex: cancer, relationships, taxes, aging, etc.). Even ol Hank Williams, Sr. is smiling from Heaven upon hearing "Tennessee Moon", a song in which ND honors the late country legend. it is the Nashville session musicians and some guest vocalists, as well as NDs countrified "Midas touch"(lets not forget those famous Neil Diamond vocals!), that makes "Tennessee Moon" worth the buy.

Upon picking up some souvenirs, I was browsing in an arts-and-crafts type souvenir shop in Edmonton, and I saw this video and decided to buy it. Needless to say, when I returned home from my vacation, I popped this tape in my VCR. Upon first viewing "Destination Canada", I thought it was an informative and picturesque documentary about the people, culture, and destinations of Canada. Theres just one, well, actually a few problems: the thing is just TOO DAMN SHORT-only less than 60 minutes long! Theres much more to see and do in this country than meets the eye here. Only Canadas top attractions and events are spotlighted in this "documentary". The narrator gives only a brief discription of Canadas provinces and territories, and gives very little, yet limited insight on its people and customs. To top it off, very little, if anything, is mentioned about the contributions of this great country and its inhabitants, such as the French and their role in shaping the province of Quebec, how the RCMP was established (including a tour of the RCMP museum in Regina, Saskatchewan), in-depth analysis of Pile O Bones (Saskatchewan), Dinosaur Provincial Park and a detailed description of the Calgary Stampede (both in Alberta) and its history. A parliamentary history and structure of Canadas role in government in the capital city of Ottawa could have been elaborated upon further as well. Dont forget about a major role the English played in helping shape this great country as well. I wouldve especially liked to have known more about how the English played a role in British Columbia, let alone how that province got its name. Whats more that could have been added was information about Canadas professional sports teams, so the sports-minded vacationer, such as myself, could know what to look for should s/he decide to take in a game or two. We cant forget about those magnificent Rocky Mountains, can we? The company who made this feature should have had the foresight to include an extra hour. Even though this video gives only a brief introduction to the Rockies, there is a video from the same company thats solely about those breathtaking mountains and its attractions. Still, this is a brief, interesting look at Canada from a travellers point of view. Although this one would be nice to have in your travel library, Im positively sure there are other (travel) documentaries that are much more informative, and for less money (at least for less than I   shelled out for this video at the souvenir shop, anyway). Pass on this one, folks, unless you like your "documentary/vacation" videos short and sweet! ',nonspam

The majority of the tracks featured here are from the Peter Gabriel years, and Phil Collins does a fine job in singing these tracks, including the tracks from the post-Gabriel era. The cream of the crop here is "Suppers Ready", an astounding 24 minutes long. This live version is a tad slower than the album version, as featured on "Foxtrot", but the musical styles featured in this version are superbly crafted and are a perfect compliment to Collins vocals, as are all the songs featured on this live musical feast. It is on this 1976 tour that Genesis hired ex-Yes, King Crimson and ex-Weather Report members Bill Bruford and Chester Thompson, respectively, to handle drumming duties so Phil Collins can freely roam the stage and focus on his vocal duties. There are some songs I wish the band had included here, such as live versions of "The Battle Of Epping Forest" and perhaps either "Stagnation" or "The Knife". I mean, cant you just imaging PC just singing these songs? "Seconds Out" is the last Genesis album featuring Steve Hackett, who left the band immediately after its release.

Based on a true story of a botched Brooklyn bank robbery heist, "Dog Day Afternoon" is a suspenseful, attention-grabbing account of a young, innocent looking man named Sonny (Pacino), who attempts to rob a bank to pay for his boyfriend/lovers (Chris Sarandon) sex-change operation. One of the films most chilling scenes occurs at the beginning, where Sonny enters the bank with his two cronies Sal (Jon Cazale) and Sonnys boyfriend (Sarandon) with a large, rectangular gift box, supposedly containing flowers. After presenting the teller with a withdrawal slip, Sonny calmly steps away from the counter, nervously, hurriedly opens the box, pulls out a rifle and shouts "Allright, freeze, nobody move!". His partner Sal also points an automatic gun at the bank manager (Sully Boyar), and the tone of the movie is set. Sonny then lets his boyfriend go when he is unable to go through with Sonnys plans. After what appears to be a clean getaway, someone outside the bank from across the street sees smoke appearing from the banks ventilator, at which time Sonny attempts to burn up the account ledger. The police and the FBI are informed about the heist, and what follows is a some two-hour hostage of everyone inside the bank. In the meantime, Sonny is attempting to negotiate with the chief of police (Charles Durning) and the head of the FBI (James Broderick) to avoid any kind of possible tragedy regarding the banks employees. Rather than give the ending of the movie away, I suggest you buy "Dog Day Afternoon" and see for yourself. The VHS version contains added bonus footage of cast and film staff interviews, so youre in for a real treat here!      ',spam

Although this film contains many very funny scenes, the chemistry that Wilder and Pryor display here isnt as strong and cohesive as in their first film "Silver Streak", but is do-able. The scenes which slow this picture down are the rodeo-escape scenes toward the end of the film, and display very little life and are somewhat boring. The plot of "Stir Crazy", though, where Wilder and Pryor are framed for armed robbery and sent to prison, is quite amusing and hilarious, with the right amount of flavor and texture to grab my attention! The fact is, any movie starring Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor, with the exception of "Another You", will command at least a four-star rating. Any die-hard fan(s) of these fine actors/performers will want to add "Stir Crazy" to their must-have collection(s).      ',nonspam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	6300989003	December 9, 2000	5	6	5.0	John Candys Finest Hour	 Since the first review I wrote on "Planes, Trains And Automobiles" didnt do this one-of-a-kind comedy classic (directed by John Hughes and stars John Candy and Steve Martin) justice, I thought Id try and outdo myself and write a better review. Needless to say, "P,T&A" has to be John Candys best and most remembered film of this late, great comic actors career. The film starts out with an advertising executive named Neal Page (Martin), who is desperately trying to get out of New York City in order to make it home to Chicago for Thanksgiving. After failing to catch a taxi on the first try from a cab racer (Kevin Bacon), Neal is having to bargain to pay to get a cab from a scrupulous attorney, while at the same time, someone is getting in Neals cab. After having paid for the taxi, the cab pulls away without Mr. Page, so he mercilessly runs after it in the middle of traffic! When he attempts to open the cab door, he briefly sees the man who stole his cab before it speeds away, who happens to be none other than our beloved shower curtain ring salesman Del Griffith (Candy)! The two later meet at the airport, and Del, at first after having denied stealing the taxi, apologized to Neal for taking his cab. Then, as if Neal Page doesnt already have enough problems, he finds out hes been bumped from first class and is placed in coach in the seat next to, you guessed it, Del Griffith! As fate would have it, our enemies-turned-friends-turned-enemies- turned-friends would be tied together throughout much of the movie. By utilizing every means of transportation possible, our boys take a plane, then a train, then a bus, then a car, then a semi (and if you count the el-train and a truck in between) to try and get home to Neals family in time for turkey. The entire journey took an eternity (two days) but what the hell, THEY DID GET HOME. Aside from the transportation, this movie has many hilarious scenes in between, such as the motel scene, the car-rental counter tirade (WARNING:EXPLICIT LANGUAGE), the burned up, charred automobile, etc. Dont forget the comical lines, which youll have to hear for yourself. Youll need to have the Kleenex handy for the ending, so make sure you have an ample supply on hand! Whenever I watch this film, I am usually left with a deep void in my life because of the fact John Candy is no longer with us. I only hope that one day Ill meet my Del Griffith in the same circumstances and well become best friends in the end. We all need a Del Griffith in our life. If youre unable to find your real-life model, then dont despair. Order your copy of "Planes, Trains And Automobiles" today! Itll make you a HUGE John Candy fan if you arent already. Happy viewing!      ',spam

With this films plot centered around a bet made by two old geezers (Ralph Bellamy, Don Ameche), this age-old question is met with some rather unique and strange results. Randolph Duke (Bellamy) makes a $1 bet with his brother Mortimer Duke (Ameche) that environment usually plays a bigger role than heredity in developing a persons personality and character. To achieve this feat, the Dukes play havoc with the lives of their star-broker employee (Dan Aykroyd) and a socially-disadvantaged street urchin (Eddie Murphy) by switching their personalities. Billy Ray Valentine (Murphy) takes Louis Winthorpe IIIs (Aykroyd) place and is successfully molded as a wealthy executive, getting Winthorpes house, car and assets, while Winthorpe is set up by the Dukes and loses all his worldly possesions and gets arrested for illegal drug posession and winds up on skid-row. Winthorpe then loses his fiance and is paired with a setimental, caring hooker (Jamie Lee Curtis), who eventually takes heed of Winthorpes plight and lets him move in with her. Valentine then learns of the Dukes scheme to switch he and Winthorpe back to their respective environments, and Valentine and Winthorpe get set to move in for the kill. They get even by putting the Dukes in the poorhouse, and make a similar $1 bet the Dukes made. This is one movie that has comedy and suspense rolled into one!

"The Jazz Singer (1980)" marks Neil Diamonds theatrical debut as an actor, that is, unless you count The Bands "The Last Waltz", in which ND makes a cameo appearance. His performance in "TJS" as an assistant cantor isnt half-bad. Complimenting Neils role quite nicely is an Oscar-winning caliber performance by the late, great Sir Laurence Olivier, who is stupendous as a stern, yet stubborn Jewish senior cantor. Ive viewed this movie quite a number of times, and what I was expecting from the first viewing was an exact remake of the original 1927 version, but that wasnt quite the case, although Ive never seen the entire original version. The premise of this version is sort of like the original, in that the premise of the story tells of an assistant cantor, Jess Robinovich, aka Robin (Diamond), whod rather write and record songs for pure enjoyment and  please his soon-to-be-fan base than remain in the synagogue and please his senior-cantor father (Olivier). Catlin Adams (Rivka Robinovich) and Lucie Arnaz (Molly Bell) offer fine supporting roles as NDs present, then future "significant other(s)". Molly is first Jess manager, then his future wife. The scenes focusing on Jess and Mollys relationship will tug at your heart strings, so its nice to have a box of Kleenex handy. Comedian/Actor Franklyn Ajaye has a role as one of Jess backup singers. Neil Diamond also wrote the songs that also appear on the soundtrack, and theyre good ones: "Love On The Rocks", America", "Hello Again", "You Baby", "Jerusalem", "Kol Nidre" and "Songs Of Life." It is also rumored that ND currently has a theatrical project in the works slated for release sometime in 2001. Its about time! Please dont wait another twenty years to release the next one, Neil! Thats why all hard-core "Diamondheads" should include "The Jazz Singer (1980)" to their video collection, because a motion picture starring Neil Diamond is hard to come by.      ',spam

Noel McCalla does a fine job on vocals, which are perfectly suited for the tracks on this album, some of which display a "Mike & The Mechanics" vibe, and somewhat better. There are too many good tracks here to determine which ones stand out, but if I had to choose, it would probably be "Moonshine" because of its up-tempo, hard-edged feel.

This double-album centers around a lost soul named Rael, who wanders the streets of New York City and finds himself in one crazy adventure after another. The Disc 1 highlights are: the title track, "Fly On A Windshield", "Broadway Melody Of 1974", "In The Cage", "The Grand Parade Of Lifeless Packaging", "Back In N.Y.C", "Counting Out Time", "The Carpet Crawlers" and "The Chamber Of 32 Doors". "Cuckoo Cocoon" and "Hairless Heart" are fine tracks as well. Disc 2 highlights: the superbly crafted instrumental "The Waiting Room", "The Supernatural Anaesthetist", the melancholic "The Lamia" and "Silent Sorrow In Empty Boats", "The Colony Of Slippermen", "Riding The Scree" (love the line "Evel Knievel, you got nothin on me!"), "In The Rapids" and "It". Nothing against "Lilywhite Lilith", "Anyway", "Ravine" and "The Light Dies Down on Broadway", as they are all well written tracks. Genesis collective genius really shone through on this album, and is one of the best of their early period. "Lamb" also marks Peter Gabriels curtain call with this remarkably talented group of musicians, who found the strength to continue onward as a unit. "Lamb" is a rather unique concept album, and this one-of-a-kind double CD gem should not be missed by any die-hard Genesis fan. This ones a must-have!      ',spam

This album contains the hit smash "Rocky Mountain Way". There are some hidden gems here as well, like the somber "Book Ends", the tame "Wolf", the Jethro Tull-esque flute vibes heard in "Days Gone By" and also in the lone instrumental "Midnight Moodies". Psychedelic folk-rock can be found in "Happy Ways", and a similar sound of Todd Rundgrens "I Went To The Mirror" can be heard in "Dreams". "Meadows" features good straight-ahead rock n roll, while the short and sweet "Daydream (Prayer)" closes out this CD on a high note.

' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000006Z8J	October 23, 2000	1	1	4.0	A nicely crafted effort	 As I stated in a prior review, I bought "Bankstatement" when it initially came out on cassette in 1989. I recently purchased it on CD, and, unlike the cassette, it contains a bonus track, titled "Diamonds Arent So Hard", which features a superbly-blended combination of Alto Saxophone and Tony Banks haunting keyboard melodies. Nearly all of the tracks on "Bankstatement" are good, except "Queen Of Darkness" and "A House Needs A Roof", both of which sound too much like an aerobics class, although "QOD" has a nice guitar/keyboard intro. Jayney Klimeks ultra-sexy, powerful vocals give these two otherwise drab tracks much needed life, while Alistair Gordons vocals on the other tracks (Throwback, Ill Be Waiting, Raincloud, The Border, The More I Hide It and Diamonds Arent So Hard) have a somewhat limited range, and are just average. "That Night" is a lovely, sentimental ballad that features both Gordon and Klimek sharing lead vocals. Tony Banks vocals on "Big Man" suits that songs lyrics and music perfectly. Its just too bad that this is Tonys only vocal appearance on "Bankstatement". TBs whirlwind keyboard style is rather effective on the lone instrumental track "Thursday The Twelfth". It is Mr. Banks chilling keyboard work on this CD that makes "Bankstatement" worth having in any Tony Banks or Genesis fans CD library. Too bad Atlantic Records in the U.S. took this one out of print, but it is still worth paying more for the import. Better buy "Bankstatement" before Virgin decides to take it out of print.

The opening track, titled "Mama", is just so-so, due to Phil Collins frightfully annoying whining throughout parts of that entire track. "Home By The Sea" and "Second Home By The Sea" feature wonderful instrumentalization throughout, particularly by Tony Banks. "Illegal Alien" finds Phil Collins sporting an annoyingly funny Mexican accent, which sort of accompanies the fiesta-like music adequately. The standout tracks here are the standoffish "Thats All", the tough-love approach of "Taking It All Too Hard" and the soulful "Its Gonna Get Better". "Silver Rainbow" features nicely crafted musicianship between Banks, Collins, and Mike Rutherford as well. "Shapes" is a nice embodiment of songs for any Genesis fan to have in their collection, which makes it a must-have CD.      ',spam

The Motown sound and psychedelia are featured in the tracks "If Leaving Me Is Easy" and "Tomorrow Never Knows" (where Phil can be heard singing a line from the Wizard Of Ozs "Over The Rainbow"- sort of unusual). Theres also a jug-band feel to "The Roof Is Leaking", and mambo rhythms featured in "Droned".

Here, Murphy plays a congenial, not exactly by-the-book Detroit cop who decides to go to Beverly Hills for a little R & R. But, he gets involved in a homicide case against his bosss wishes. Along the way, he teams up with Beverly Hills Detective Taggart and his assistant Rosewood (the latter played by Judge Reinhold), and the recipe calls for suspense, intrigue and a little comedy along the way. The stunt where Murphy gets thrown through a glass window by Victor Maitlands (Steven Berkoff) gang of thugs is just fabulous, and the "banana in the tailpipe" thing is hilarious! Bronson Pinchot is also featured here in an early role as Serge, the gay art shop owner. Lets not forget the films soundtrack, with songs by Patti Labelle, The Pointer Sisters and Glenn Frey, which is an ecellent companion to "Beverly Hills Cop". All of the above mentioned are excellent reasons to include "Beverly Hills Cop" in your video library.      ',spam

Truckers will get a kick out of C.W. McCalls CB craze song "Convoy", which inspired a hit movie of the same name. This collection of 70s songs just wouldnt be complete without the sugar-coated disco vibes of Hot Chocolates "You Sexy Thing". "At Seventeen" by Janis Ian is just average, and Austin Roberts "Rocky" is just plain boring. Dwight Twilleys "Im On Fire" rocks the house down, so you better not crank this number up too loud, or your house will look like a pile of rubble! I found David Geddes "Run Joey Run" to be quite asinine (in laymens terms, that means stupid). For those of you into 50s nostalgia, theres Pete Wingfields "Eighteen With A Bullet".

As you might have guessed from this review so far, a majority of the songs here have a dark and moody feeling to them, and that suits even the most die-hard Genesis fan, such as myself, just fine. It has been said that Ray Wilsons singing style is comparable to Peter Gabriels, which also has a dimly-lit, chilly feel to it. It is that type of quality that gives "...CAS..." such a distinctive flavor. That unique flavor can be heard in Tony Banks keyboard/synthesizer playing in "The Dividing Line" and "There Must Be Some Other Way". Mike Rutherford makes good use of his guitar playing qualities in songs like "Shipwrecked", " "Not About Us", "If Thats What You Need", "Alien Afternoon", "Small Talk" and the title track. Nice African-Caribbean influences can be heard in "Congo", and "Uncertain Weather" features some "chills down your spine" vibes. Overall, theres not really a bad song on the entire CD. With all this talent, including Ray Wilsons vocals, it would be a shame if Genesis doesnt continue onward. We will have to wait and see. That is why even the most ardent Genesis fan should add "...Calling All Stations..." to their CD collection. Oh, and it also features superb drumming by Nir Z. and nice musicianship from Nick DViriglio as well.      ',spam

Although its not as good as in the first "Smokey And The Bandit", it has nice country music numbers by Ed Bruce and Lee Greenwood. Also included are nice rockers by John Stewart titled "It Aint The Gold" and "Ticket For The Wind". They provide a somewhat refreshing change of pace compared to the obviously all-country soundtrack featured in the first two Smokies. Jerry Reed as The Bandit. Yeah, I know he isnt Burt Reynolds, but he provides a rather captivating performance here as the primo "All-American Redneck Lawbreaker." Jackie Gleason as Sheriff Buford T. Justice. Gleason reprises his role as the famous Texas lawman whod like nothing more than to capture the Bandit. The car chases are splendid involving the Sheriff and The Bandit, but as a minus, lack the gusto provided in the first two movies. The plot. I found the plot where Sheriff Justice carries a stuffed fish on the roof of his squad car to be quite funny, yet bewildering. The Enis Brothers. Who in heck would drive around in a Cadillac filled with milk? Beats me! Burt Reynolds cameo. A bit short, but need I say more? Yes, because we havent gotten to the minuses yet. Colleen Camp. She is NO Sally Field! Faith Minton. I thought having a nymphomaniac character in the film was the lowest point here. The same, tiresome jokes. after seeing the first two Smokies, the old jokes just werent funny anymore. And the new jokes persented in this movie, like where Sheriff Justice was pointing out to his dimwitted son that all the lawmen in the Justice family have "six sense", and his son replies, "Six cents, thats not even a dime". Oh, PUH-LEASE!  Based on this films assessment, you can plainly see there are more pluses than minuses. Thats why you should add "Smokey And The Bandit, Part 3" to your video library. Oh, and the biggest plus is when Jerry Reed says: "I get to be The Bandit, I get to be The Bandit!" WOO-HOO!      ',nonspam

Here, EJ experiments with certain musical styles ranging from the jazz-laden "Big Dipper" to the countrified "Georgia". Theres also straight-ahead rock featured in "I Dont Care" and "Part-Time Love", an AM Top-40 radio staple in 1978. The pyrotechnical, yet powerful "Madness" breathes more life into "A Single Man", while "It Aint Gonna Be Easy" tends to bring the album down just a melancholic tad.

Columbia/CBS Records did a very intelligent thing by putting all this wonderful music that was originally released on a double-album onto a single CD, saving valuable time and money for the consumer. Chicago Transit Authoritys first self-titled album gives the listener a grand audio insight of what would become this groups trademark sound-its brassy and mardi gras-like horn section featured on songs like "Questions 67 And 68", "Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?", "Beginnings" and "Introduction". The audio byte at the beginning of "Prologue/Someday" from the 1968 Democratic National Convention gives this number a "grasroots" socio-political feel to it, and the closing live track "Liberation", is a bit long-winded, but caps off a nice, rousing finish.

Hmm...lets see...For starters, I would buy myself five or six mansions in different parts of the world, possibly start up a car collection, or perhaps take a few dozen trips around the world and deposit the rest in a bank account. The point is, "Brewsters Millions" is a delightful comedy that stars Richard Pryor as a down and out ex-professional baseball player who must spend thirty million dollars in thirty days. If he is successful, hell inherit $300,000,000. Sounds easy, right? The catch is that Mr. Pryor must have no assets of any kind after the thirty days to obtain the money. John Candy co-stars as Pryors buddy and is an "en route" benefactor to Pryors real fortune. Stephen Collins also co-stars as an attorney who would like nothing more than to con Pryor out of his millions so he can obtain the fortune for his future firm Granville and Baxter. Pat Hingle does an outstanding job as the overseer of the conditions of Montgomery Brewsters (Pryor) great uncles (Hume Cronyn) will. All this makes for a well-crafted, suspensful comedy. o do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of "Brewsters Millions" today. Chuck Fleming (Peter Jason), Action News!      ',spam

After the third viewing, I decided to stop trying to make sense of it all, and just take the contents at face value. This is a delightfully well scripted and funny masterpiece which stars Malcolm Mc Dowell as Mick Travis, a coffee salesman who finds himself going from one outlandish adventure to another. What makes this movie such a joy to watch is that the same actors play different roles throughout the movie, as well as the bizarre plot, characters and storyline. Get a load of that pigman!

I bought the CD many, many years later, and just as before, the music is as fresh and vibrant as that first day I listened to the 8-track! The majority of the songs here are tight-fisted soul and r&b, from the eclectically pleasing "What Can I Say", to up-tempo numbers "Jump Street" and "Its Over", to the blue-eyed soul/reggae vibes of "Love Me Tomorrow". I prefer Bozs version of "Were All Alone" to Rita Coolidges, which runs a very close second. A fan of Boz Scaggs or even soul music will have a delight out of this marvelous array of songs, which is why I highly recommend "Silk Degrees".      ',spam

This 1976 comedy-action thriller stars Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor, who make their debut together here. Jill Clayburgh also stars as Wilders love interest. George Caldwell (Wilder) is a Los Angeles businessman who wants to take a vacation, so he decides to take a train to Chicago to relax and get some work done. But, little does Caldwell know he is in the ride of his life, and he encounters some hooligans on this journey. Add guys like Patrick McGoohan, Ray Walston and Richard Kiel (who play bad guys, of course), throw in a sexy blonde secretary (Jill Clayburgh), and add a vitamin salesman-turned federal agent (Ned Beatty), and youve got the makings of a suspense filled-edge of you seat action thriller, directed by Arthur Hiller (Im a poet and dont know it!).

Genesis even take a swipe at televangelism with "Jesus He Knows Me", which has its hilarious, yet truthful side. "Fading Lights" turned out to be a fitting swan song for Phil Collins, who left the group almost four and a half years later after "We Can"t Dance" was released.

"Three Dog Nightmare" is an insightful tour de force, and will take the average reader on a journey through Chucks rise as a college basketball player, then as a singer in various bands leading up to Three Dog Night. It is in this group where Mr. Negron begins to experiment with various drugs, including cough syrup. He then discovers the more potent drugs (marijuana, LSD, cocaine) which will eventually lead to his downfall, and to the dismissal of Three Dog Night. At his lowest point, Chuck finds himself as a useless, burned out hardcore drug addict and eventually becomes homeless. Then, redemption sets in, finding success in beating his addiction at his 37th rehab center, Cri-Help. He finally gets his music career back on track, and agrees to get his message across to others, including to offer help to other hardcore drug users, like he was. Hence, "Three Dog Nightmare". Once you start reading this, you will not want to put it down! Also, you might want to pick up Chucks CD "The Long Road Back". It is a wonderful accompaniment to the book. Both items are a must have for any Three Dog Night fan, as well as anyone facing personal struggles in their life. Enjoy!      ',spam

"A Trick Of The Tail"  contains an equally impressive ballad titled "Ripples", and  "Robbery, Assault And Battery" has somewhat of a comical side.  This CD also marks the first of a long line of pure instrumentals in  "Los Endos", a rolicking, progressive piece of music. Please Buy  this CD, along with the groups follow-up "Wind & Wuthering".  Either or both of these CDs are a delight to have in your colection!      ',spam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B00004STNL	September 5, 2000	2	2	4.0	In The Beginning...	 "From Genesis To Revelation" is the first of a long line of  albums from a gifted and talented group of musicians known as Genesis. The  music on this CD can be described as a cross between early The Moody Blues  and early The Bee Gees. The music on FGTR is easy listening throughout, and  has pleasant tracks like "Am I Very Wrong, "The Conquerer",  "One Day", "In Hiding", "A Place To Call My  Own" and "The Silent Sun", which was Genesis first single  released in Britain. Not bad for a groups first album. FGTR is produced by  Johnathan King, who had a hit with "Everyones Gone To The Moon"  in 1965. The members of Genesis at the time of FGTR were students at  Londons famous Charterhouse School, and graduated soon afterward.  Personnel and managerial changes would develop by the time Genesis started  work on their second album, "Trespass." FGTR is a nice collection  of songs for any Genesis fan to have in their repertoire.      ',nonspam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000002J1E	September 5, 2000	1	1	5.0	One of prog-rocks best	 "Close To The Edge" is the best early Yes album, if not the  all-time greatest Yes album of their entire catalog. The best track here is  the lengthy "Close To The Edge Suite", where the intro opens with  a "tranqil sea" instrumentation, then breaks into a hard line  guitar and bass piece. Total Mass Retain features a banjo-line in certain  parts, and I Get Up, I Get Down has another hard line bass sound etched  throughout, then that "tranqui sea" fades out at the end.  "And You And I" has a folksy, mellow feel to it, while  "Siberian Khatru" just fades into black. The ability to shift  musical themes as well as provide chilling, gripping lyrics is what makes  Yes so talented. Youll feel the same way after listening to this CD.      ',spam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000002NZO	September 5, 2000	0	0	4.0	The best is yet to come	 Fresh off the heels of their 1969 debut "From Genesis To  Revelation", the band felt they needed a fresh approach for their next  album, 1970s "Trespass." Genesis got themselves a new manager  and recorded this sophmoric effort in the English countryside to give the  album a "grass roots" British feel to it. The results appeared to  work, but many Genesis fans felt the best was yet to surface from this  quintet just out of the Charterhouse School in London. The polished tracks  here are "Stagnation" and "The Knife." Some personnel  changes would develop after this album as well. Guitarist Anthony Phillips  and drummer John Mayhew departed, with the former putting out an occasional  solo album. Genesis fans would then be treated to the classic lineup, aka  "the best yet to come."      ',nonspam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000002J1B	September 5, 2000	1	2	3.0	Good...but not Yes best	 After the first listen of "Relayer", here is my assessment: the  opening track "The Gates Of Delirium" has the band attempting to  "fine-tune" their instruments, yet the tracks hard-rock vibes  appeal to me. "Sound Chaser" is more of the same, but with  annoying neanderthallic chants throughout the second half. The closing  track "To Be Over, is the best of the three, with its mellow,  melancholy feel and tranquil lyrics. "Relayer is just an average CD at  best, but still worthy of Yes fans to add to their collection.      ',nonspam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000002J2B	September 5, 2000	0	0	5.0	A worthy follow-up	 "Wind And Wuthering" is a worthy follow-up to "Trick Of The  Tail", and equals that album both musically and lyrically. W &Ws  opening track "Eleventh Earl Of Mar" gives the listener some  insight on the journey upon which the songs take. "Eleventh Earl Of  Mar" could represent a course of action taken, while "One For The  Vine" could be representative of ones fate under adverse  circumstances. "All In A Mouses Night" can be taken as someone  striving to obtain something worthy of being searched, yet searching for it  under dangerous circumstances. "Unquiet Slumbers For The  Sleepers" is an instrumental piece which can be interpreted to mean  that someone is traveling a smooth paved road after obtaining what that  person wanted, then weathering a difficult storm ahead: riding a rocky  road, then caught in a violent whirlpool. Then we get to  "Afterglow", where our person in peril   finally sails on a sea  of tranquility and finally reaches his destination. The interpretations  listed here can convey different meanings. "Your Own Special Way"  was the first Genesis song to reach the U.S. Billboad Hot 100. "Wind  & Wuthering" displays fine singing from Phil Collins, and  excellent musicianship from Tony Banks, Mike Rutherford and Steve Hackett,  who departed from Genesis shortly after this album. I recommend you buy  this CD!      ',spam

I recently bought the remastered version of "Foxtrot" on CD, and in comparison to the original non-mastered previous version of "Foxtrot", needless to say, I couldnt tell the difference in sound quality. This is still a great CD, remastered or not. Its just a shame that none of the CD titles in the Genesis Definitive Edition Remaster Series contain bonus tracks, although, according to various sources surrounding the Genesis camp, there are/were quite a number of "throwaway" singles the band could have included here. For instance, the Definitive Edition Remaster of "Selling England By The Pound" should have contained the bonus track "Twilight Alehouse", but, for some reason, either the record company (Atlantic) or the band decided not to include it. To my knowledge, no extra tracks were recorded during the "Foxtrot" sessions. The least Atlantic could have done was to include one or two live selections from the "Foxtrot" tour on this remastered version. In the way of sheer brilliance and originality, this is still a five-star work of art, nonetheless. The standout track on "Foxtrot" is the 23 minute long and delghtful "Suppers Ready". I love those silly, profound lyrics, and the varying musical styles used throughout "Suppers Ready" are astounding! Youll find other choice cuts here as well, like the opening track "Watcher Of The Skies", "Time Table", "Get Em Out By Friday" and "Can-Utility And The Coastliners."

Peter Gabriels vocals take on a "thespian style,  particularly on the opening track "The Musical Box", where Tony  Banks use of the Mellotron is quite fluent, as is the case on the majority  of the tracks here.

Each and every song here diplays a  wealth of artistic arrangements and talent. The creme de la creme musically  is Tony Banks work on the Mellotron on songs like "Dancing With The  Moonlit Knight", and on the instrumental "After The Ordeal"  and "The Cinema Show." Mike Rutherfords use of the Sitar on  "I Know What I Like" is also appreciated. Phil Collins adds his  vocals on his lone track here titled "More Fool Me", a weepy,  senimental ballad. Lets not forget the comical "The Ballad Of Epping  Forest", a well thought out laugh fest! Gotta love the lines  "Accountants keep a score, 10-4, "The blue bell are ringing for  sweet, clear Sam, clear ham, handing out bread and jam, just like any  picnic...picnic!... picnic!" how about this line: "The butlers  got jam on his lens like dough out of the pot, with teeth on a silver pot  just like any picnic!...picnic!... picnic!...picnic!" Sorry, but I  couldnt help overindulging myself! The point is, with Genesis, typically  early Genesis, you never know what to expect. aside from the excellent  musicianship displayed on "Selling England", Peter Gabriels  vocals are nothing to sneeze at.

Boy, was I taken aback! What a witty and talented  songwriter/musician Mr. Buffett is! This is evidenced in the track  "Cliches", where the song opens with "Hes got a ballpark  figure, shes got a ballpoint pen." My favorite lyrics occur later in  the track:"Hes always tuned into Star Trek, shes always tuned into  him. Hiding his cookies when he gets the munchies, tryin hard just to keep  the boy slim". "My Head Hurts, My Feet Stink And I Dont Love  Jesus" is a laugh riot! This CD also has a melacholy side, featured in  the track "The Captain And The Kid", which is a reworking from  one of JBs earlier albums. "Big Rig" is an enjoyful, up-tempo  number that also contains a comical line: "Id rather much be home  rollin with you than watchin Tom Snyder on TV."

This is not a bad CD to say the least, and  many of the heavily synthesized tracks provide a welcomely refreshing  change of pace in songs like the title track "Headed For The  Future", "Stand Up For Love", and the Stevie Wonder penned  "Lost In Hollywood", on which Stevie provides the keyboards. This  CD also has its melancholy side with tracks like "The Man You  Need" and "It Should Have Been Me", as well as sentimental  tracks ("Ill See You On The Radio) Laura" and "Me Beside  You".

Here, the most  ardent ND fan will find heartwarming ballads (If You Know What I Mean, Home  Is A Wounded Heart, Lady-Oh), good-time standards (Stargazer, the title  track, Jungletime) and the feel-good "Dont Think...Feel".  Robertson also contributes musically here, playing guitar on songs like the  equally touching "Dry Your Eyes".

You would expect  from this albums title that the songs featured here would display a lot of  heartfelt emotion-guess again. While NDs previous effort, Stones, ran the  gamut of emotions ranging from happy to sad and somewhere in between,  Moods, on the other hand, displays emotions ranging from happy to downright  silly. This range of motion is prevalent in the songs "Song Sung  Blue", "Play Me", "Captain Sunshine",  "Morningside", "Walk On Water", "Porcupine  Pie" and "Gitchy Goomy".

Some  of the songs feature a somewhat moody persona (The Last Thing On My Mind,  Suzanne, I Think Its Gonna Rain Today) thatll leave you feeling maybe a  little melancholy. The up-tempo "Crunchy Granola Suite" will have  you singing and humming the lyrics, and perhaps dancing. Joni Mitchell  penned a song titled "Chelsea Morning", which shows up on this  CD. Roger Miller even contributed to this collection as well, with the  unforgivingly interpersonal "Husbands And Wives." The CDs title  track is a classic in its own right. The signature track here is the  autobiagraphical "I Am...I Said- a song Neil Diamond stated that its  been his hardest song to write to date, which took him four months to  compose. It was well worth the wait, for I Am...I Said is one of Neils  most memorable songs. Lee Holdridges musical arrangements really shine  here as well.

This is the geographic region where this prized author spent all of his time (generally outdoors) writing and observing, and was a very studious "freak of nature", so to speak. A surprisingly interesting read, "Of Mice And Men" focuses on two subjects named George and Lennie. George dreams of getting steady work on an animal farm, while his aimless, slow-witted friend (Lennie) has an ongoing desire to pet (and mangle) mice and other assorted creatures. These two take up residence with various other persons along their evasive journey as well. But, theres one pressing problem: Could George tame Lennie long enough to help make this dream a reality? You, just like our two "heroes", will have to journey through the vast rivers and valleys of Salinas to find out!

"Rudy" - the 1993 blockbuster starring Sean Astin in the title role, is one motion picture that reminds us no goal or obstacle is too big or too small to be accomplished successfully, if one is willing to persevere through all hardships. "Rudy" gets this message across to the viewer quite well, and with no major stumbling blocks or any errors, for that matter. Determined to defy all those who doubt his dream of playing football at the University of Notre Dame, Daniel "Rudy" Ruettiger sets off for South Bend, Indiana with a duffle bag filled with hopes and a bus ticket. Once arriving at his intended destination, he is met by a caring Catholic priest (Robert Prosky), who sees Rudys heart and desire, and is determined to help this young man accomplish his goal. A timeline is established, where Rudy must maintain a respectable grade point average at Holy Cross Junior College in a years time. If grades are successfully met, hell be one step closer to realizing his dream of both playing football for the Fighting Irish, thus gaining admission into Notre Dame. Adding a bit more meat and potatoes to "Rudy"s storyline, are fine, upstanding, believable performances from Ned Beatty (as Rudys father), Scott Benjaminson (as Rudys doubting Thomas brother), Lili Taylor (as Rudys girlfriend) and Jason Miller (as legendary ND coach Ara Parseghian). Charles S. Duttons performance as the head stadium groundskeeper mustnt be overlooked, either. To sum everything up, "Rudy" is a film thats about more than just football. Its about conquering mountains, big and small, which isnt impossible, as long as one keeps their nose to the grindstone, or, in this case, to the gridiron. Having doubts about whether or not you can win lifes battles? See this movie. Hearing nothing but negativity from those around you while en route to accomplishing your goal? See this movie. Do you dream of getting a college degree, and want to make it a reality? SEE THIS MOVIE!!! Oh, and see if you can spot the cameo appearance of Mr. Daniel Ruettiger himself (INTERESTING TIDBITS: The exterior shot of the Holy Cross College campus, is actually one of the colleges on the Notre Dame campus. The scene in the campus coffee shop where Rudy and D-Bob (Jon Favreau [another actor I (almost) overlooked!]) are talking/studying, is shot in NDs OShaughnessy Hall, and the interior Holy Cross classroom scenes were filmed at a nearby high school).

' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000002J27	May 25, 2003	2	3	5.0	Gabriel may be gone, but Genesis carry on	 Upon Peter Gabriels departure following "The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway" tour in 1975, the British press were predicting the death of Genesis, because they assumed Peter wrote everything, and therefore he WAS Genesis. The truth was that Gabriel wrote mostly all of the lyrics, while the rest of the music was composed by the other four members. After the smoke had cleared, Genesis was left a quartet, and therefore were determined to prove to the world Genesis were still the giants of the progressive rock scene, as well as make the British press eat their own words. And boy, did Phil Collins, Michael Rutherford, Tony Banks and Steve Hackett make the media eat those words, or what? The music on "A Trick of the Tail" will definitely attest to that fact. Even though Peter Gabriel may be gone from the band, his spirit is still etched in a majority of the selections here. The opening track, "Dance On A Volcano" gets "Trick..." moving in grand, artsy progressive fashion, and the progressive traits never let up through the entire CD. This is followed by the gorgeous Steve Hackett/Tony Banks composition "Entangled" - where Banks mellotron intricacies and Hacketts signature guitar virtuosity lead the way. Then, its on to the hard-hitting punch of "Squonk", perhaps the proggiest song on "ATOTT". This is where Collins vocals are at their most harsh, which add a greater degree of character to this Banks/Rutherford composition. The desert swept nuances of "Mad Man Moon" close out the first half of "ATOTT", and its on to the latter half. The beginning of the second half starts off with what is perhaps the weakest song on "Trick..." - the slightly "off-color" humor of "Robbery, Assault & Battery". The cops & robbers story featured here doesnt exactly grab my interest, thus, it lacks a characteristic which made Gabriel-era Genesis such a pleasure to listen to. Peter Gabriel brought such a unique air of wit and character depth to each individual role on record, that it breathed such life into the songs. Phil Collins, on the other hand, brings very little, if any, life to the charaterizations here and on "Wind & Wuthering", that they all sound very monotonous, thus sucking all the humor out of the otherwise witty story. Then, it is on to the other best song on the CD, the unpretentiously beautiful "Ripples". When listening to this track and "Entangled", it is easy to see how Steve Hacketts musical and (painfully few) lyrical contributions were important to the production of this album (including "Wind & Wuthering" to the same degree) and to Genesis as a unified whole. The title track is almost a sharp contrast to both of the above tracks, as it would sort of foreshadow the pop music that was in their future. "Los Endos" closes the CD with a thunderous bang, and is quite fusiony, featuring ballsy jazz/rock influences. Phil Collins would immediately explore this territory with Brand X - with which he would join upon the release of "ATOTT". As far as the remastered version of "Trick..." is concerned, the overall quality of sound is a drastic improvement, when compared to the first generation version. In the remastered edition, one can now hear the crispness of the mellotron, guitar and drum sounds, which all sounded fuzzy on the first generation British CD I own. Even Phil Collins vocals on this "new and improved" version sound more strong and more muscular, a great improvement over his "mousey" style, as presented on the early CD. Even the texture contained within the CD booklets contents is a 360 degree improvement. Whereas the older CD booklet contained black and white illustrations on a white background, the remastered CD booklet contains all color illustrations - brown figures on a goldenrod background, making it a virtual rainbow cornucopia. Now, with "A Trick of the Tail" completed, Genesis accomplished at least two major feats. One, they made "ATOTT" a huge seller, which outsold all prior Genesis releases up to that point. Two, they finally sent the critics and their narrow-minded viewpoints packing, letting them know that Genesis was here to stay. Athough this legendary band is now no more, their spirit has never left since. With that said, no progressive rock collection is complete without "A Trick of the Tail" and the groups follow up "Wind & Wuthering" added to your classic Genesis collection.      ',spam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000007UCR	May 5, 2003	11	12	5.0	"Geese/Ghost" is an essential Prog masterpiece	 After departing from Genesis almost seven years earlier in 1970, Anthony Phillips released his first solo record, "The Geese and the Ghost, in 1977, although Phillips wasnt the first member of the band to release a solo album (that honor goes to Steve Hackett, who beat Phillips to the punch, by releasing "Voyage of the Acolyte", in 1975). Upon the initial listening of "TG&TG", it would appear the lengthy "sabbatical" Phillips took would cause his musical skills to suffer from a case of "rustitis", but thats far from the truth. On the contrary, the lengthy absence helped him mature his craft, making "Geese..." perhaps one of the most underrated works in all of progressive rock. In practical hindsight, this is a work rich in progressive undertones, with classical influences dominating most of the selections. One listen to the title suites: "The Geese and the Ghost, Parts 1 & 2", will confirm this fact. Joining Phillips on this breathtaking journey, are Genesis mates Mike Rutherford and Phil Collins, whose vocal performances on "Which Way The Wind Blows?" and on "God If I Saw Her Now" are among the best of his career. Speaking of another above-mentioned (ex)-Genesis member, Steve Hackett, whose brother John makes an important contribution to "TG&TG" on flute. Another breathtaking contribution worthy of mention, is Anthony Phillips vocal performance on another of the few vocal tracks, that being the melancholic "Collections", including the bonus track that closes the CD, the acoustic-driven "Master of Time (Demo Version)". Including the Genesis and solo albums "Wind & Wuthering" and Mike Rutherfords 1980 release "Smallcreeps Day" (on which Phillips guests), "The Geese and the Ghost" is the last true progressive masterwork on which both Collins and Rutherford would have the pleasure of recording before they (along with Tony Banks) would take Genesis in a different musical direction, and not 100% for the better on future releases - 1978s "...And Then There Were Three..." notwithstanding. Since "Geese..." is such a lush and complex work of art, it may take a few listens to grasp all its eccentricities. Catch this "Geese" (or "Goose") soon, before it migrates south, permanently! Oh, and this particular one is THE perfect companion with Steve Hacketts "Spectral Mornings", making both titles as must-haves for your Genesis library.      ',nonspam

One listen to "Spectral Mornings" (Steve Hacketts third solo album, and his second since leaving Genesis), alongside the first post-Hackett Genesis album "...And Then There Were Three..." should confirm all truths and suspicions of where the true musical spirit within the above classic band resided. It really resided within both Hackett and Peter Gabriel, both of whom provided a uniquely sound and in-depth musical (and lyrical) concept within the bands tightly-knit (wall of sound) structure. Not to take anything away from either Tony Banks, Phil Collins or Mike Rutherford - all of whom are exceptionally talented musicians in their own right. Its just that, in my humble opinion, Genesis lost some credibility soon after Gabriel, and later Hackett, left - meaning that the wall of sound which made Genesis a household name in the world of progressive rock, would cease to exist as soon as the group trimmed down to a three-piece. At this point in time, only the name of the band remained the same throughout its lengthy history. Anyway, the first Steve Hackett album, "Voyage of the Acolyte" (1975) demonstrated Hacketts ability to experiment with different musical styles in grand fashion, all while remaining within the musical restraints of his soon to be former band at the time. Hacketts sophomore effort, "Please Dont Touch" (1978), finds him using a slightly different musical approach, but more variances are found there, both musically and personally, espeially the latter. Hackett used a lineup of performers from different musical genres (Richie Havens, Randy Crawford, Steve Walsh and Phil Ehart [both of Kansas] to create an even balance of effective musicianship and lyrical spontaneity. Whereas "VotA" contained mostly a more ralaxed, and, at certain points, a more evasive intrumental approach, "Spectral Mornings" (1979) mostly cuts to the chase, delivering straight-ahead, mostly progressive rock, in even fashion. Also, the lyrical output is solid, being brought out like a full harvest blossom, courtesy of Hacketts songwriting capabilities (as well as on the guitar, Hacketts "raison detre") and Pete Hicks passionate vocals. The instrumentals are no slouches either, for theyre the reason which makes "SM" such a provocative and special masterpiece. "The Red Flower of Tachai Blooms Everywhere" is among the pick of the litter of the instrumentals here, complete with a unique East Asian flair, which words cannot describe. It must be listened to (in full) in order to be wholly appreciated. The title instrumental follows right behind, and contains a homogenous blend of both wonderfully sound soft and hard "progressive" textures. Theres a humorous side to this record as well, as is wonderfully executed in "The Ballad of the Decomposing Man (Scenes From The Office Party)". This track is the perfect musical companion to Emerson, Lake & Palmers "Benny The Bouncer" (from "Brain Salad Surgery"), complete with a "quasi-styled" gay nineties theme. This selection features some witty lyrics as well. "Spectral Mornings" other selections shouldnt be ignored as well, although one or two of these hint at commercialism, especially the opening track "Every Day" - with its catchy melodies and chorus, although its still an upstanding number, nevertheless. When comparing most of Hacketts and Genesis future works from this point onward, its easy to see that the former took one giant leap forward, while the latter took two major leaps backward. Again, one needs to only listen to "SM" and "...ATTWT..." side by side to remove all doubts and suspicions of where the true musicianship of Genesis truly resided within the band (even though I happen to be quite fond of "...ATTWT..." - being that its my favorite record from the trio era). So, just sit back and take in these introspective "Spectral Mornings". Theres no better way to put your time to good use!      ',nonspam

If one needs proof of Robin Williams dramatic acting skills, then he/she needs to look no further than last years highly effective "One Hour Photo". Here, Williams cinematic performance is worth many a rave review, and clearly puts him in the spotlight, up close and personal as Sy "the one hour photo guy". We look in on our study in action, working as a lab photo technician at a Wal-Mart-type knockoff. While developing many a photograph, one particular family catches Sys eye, as well as his personal camera lens, as Sys job becomes his personal obsession, an obsession that could wind up going too far if Sy isnt careful. In fact, this job means everything to our photography expert, as this storyline is conveyed clearly to the viewer. As the film progresses, the story itself becomes more intense, with the action becoming even more developmental with each passing scene. But, Robin Williams, whose performance here is nothing short of breathtakingly spectacular, isnt the only star whose performance shouldnt go unnoticed. Kudos should also go to Gary Cole, whose performance as a superstore manager and Sys boss, although somewhat brief, is also worthy of high marks, especially in the intensity dept.. Coles character is the absolutely perfect opposite foil of Williams character, where the latter exhibits a Type B personality as opposed to Coles Type A demeanor. With so many hooks to keep the frequent moviegoer (and regular video purchaser) entertained, and with its star and supporting casts performances to boot (including Eriq La Salles [of "ER" and "Coming To America" fame] credible role as a police detective), "One Hour Photo" just might earn Robin Williams the Best Actor Oscar of 2002.

' A103KNDW8GN92L	B00005AFMT	March 23, 2003	1	2	4.0	A strong return for King Crimson	 After retiring King Crimson after recording the "Red" LP in 1974, Robert Fripp felt the group accomplished all it could both musically and lyrically, thus going out with a monstrous bang at that point. Fripp, along with guitarist Adrian Belew, stick bassist/synth player Tony Levin and drumming ace Bill Bruford, reformed a new and revitalized Crimson lineup (with only Fripp and Bruford returning from the previous 1970s lineup) in 1981. This fantastic foursome released three albums in the 1980s, beginning with "Discipline" (otherwise known as the other "Red" album). "Discipline" shows Crimson at its most in-depth and at its most productive musically, even after a nearly seven-year absence, and with half of its lineup including two new members to boot. Fripp demonstrates unique guitar sounds on "Discipline"s opening track, "Elephant Talk", while the rest of the band is solid on "Frame By Frame". Belew writes some of his most romantically profound lyrics on one of Crimsons more bluesy numbers, "Matte Kudasai". However, things get more decadently tense on the remaining instrumentals - especially "Indiscipline", where Fripp, Belew and Bruford each display a virtually insightful musicians clinic, which blends together rather professionally. Ah, but the bass/stick synth talents of Tony Levin need not go unnoticed here on "Discipline", either, as he brings a jarring presence to the forefront on yet another instrumental, "Thela Hun Ginjeet". "The Sheltering Sky" also brings with it its own musical notariety, complete with subtle nuances as deep as the midnight sky. Tony Levin also puts in a noteworthy performance on the latter track as well. The self-titled instrumental (Another one? How discreetly delicious and thoughtful of these guys!) adds yet more depth and "Discipline" to Crimsons repertoire, and closes out the CD on a strong and positive note. The LP sleeve version of "Discipline" contains a bonus track, a reprise of "Matte Kudasai (alternate version)", sort of a continuation of the third track. Of the three albums King Crimson released in the 80s ("Discipline", "Beat" and "Three of a Perfect Pair"), the first and the third offerings make for strong bookends in both the musical and lyrical department, while the middle entry falters due to splattery and disjointed production for the most part (except for "Beat"s two strong instrumentals "Sartori in Tangier" and "Requiem"). Even though Crimsons usually strong jazz intricacies are neatly tucked away beneath the new wave and bluesy introspections on "Discipline", it is still the strongest effort of their 80s outings, but still doesnt quite match up with their 1970s musical majestics. So, "Discipline" yourself to get off of that sofa, and make a trip down to your retailer and purchase this title today. If you miss the bygone era of vinyl-type packaging without the plastic black discs inside, then the LP sleeve packaging of "Discipline" is definitely the way to go!      ',nonspam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B00005AFMS	March 15, 2003	2	7	3.0	King Crimsons "Pop" Masterpiece?	 King Crimson has released some spectacularly crafted and musically insightful masterworks throughout their lengthy career, especially their 1960s and 70s output. After ending the latter decade with the explosive "Red", Robert Fripp decided to retire Crimson, feeling the band went as far as it could go creatively as well as musically. In 1981, Fripp reformed King Crimson once again - replacing lead vocalist and bassist John Wetton with Adrian Belew (guitar and lead vocals) and Tony Levin (stick, bass synth). Only Fripp (guitar and Frippertronics) and Bill Bruford (percussion) returned from the previous lineup. The latter four musicians released "Discipline" in 1981. In 1982, Belew, Fripp, Levin and Bruford released their second record together, "Beat". All previous Crimson lineups prior to this one (and afterward) were always known for churning out innovative melodies, combined with an over the top musical craftsmanship, all performed on a highly professional musical level. Unfortunately, theres very little of the above qualities displayed on "Beat". Most of the selections here are nothing more than cheesy, half-baked attempts at "stylish" new wave and synthesized pop. Add to what little "Beat" has already going for it, are the lions share of the trite, aimless lyrics written by Belew, which, for the most part, can be written by your average preschooler. In fact, a majority of preschoolers can write more insightful lyrics than these. The only track that has any noteworthy semblance of strength in the "Creative Writing 101, Inc", Dept., is the descriptive "Neurotica". If there is even the slightest notion to include "Beat" to your "essential" CD collection, it is the two instrumentals "Sartori In Tangier" and "Requiem", although on Crimsons next release, "Three of a Perfect Pair", "Nuages (That Which Passes, Passes Like Clouds)" and "Industry" are stronger instrumentals, both of which feature strong stick and bass playing and knock em dead percussives, both supplied to the nth degree by Levin and Bruford, respectively. As for the musicianship on "Beat", the star player here is Tony Levin, who shows the most depth of the four musically, with the other three basically phoning in their licks - which, for the most part, are blatantly repetitive and lack focus. This says a lot for both Fripp and Bruford, who are usually superior musicians in their own right - except on "Beat", when compared to most other Crimson works falls flat on its face both musically and lyrically. Unless youre a die-hard Crimson fan, Id strongly recommend leaving "Beat" out of your all-important CD collection. But, if you must have it, purchase it for the two instrumentals mentioned above, and for the CD booklets pictures and newspaper articles. Otherwise, "Beat" leaves no lasting impression.

' A103KNDW8GN92L	B00004SX3H	February 25, 2003	2	2	5.0	Fripp and Crimson break musical ground once again!	 In the words of guitar master Robert Fripp: "King Crimson once again reinvents itself. We have a new wheel." Hence, the wheel contained in this, "The ConstruKction of Light" rolls through quite smoothly, and without any noticeable "squeaks", either! Crimson has never rocked harder, a fact to which all eleven numbers will attest. Speaking of reinventing, Adrian Belew does just that with his often-refined vocal stylings, which come through loud and clear on the opening "ProzaKc Blues". It is the catatonically disturbing and heart-pulsatingly descriptive musicianship of master bassist Trey Gunn and all over the boards drummer Pat Mastelotto which adds to the dark and ominous tone to all the selections here. Belews depressing lyrics add the finishing touch to the chillingly deceptive theme which runs throughout this "construKctive" masterwork. Upon hearing Mastelottos stormy, cutting-edge drumming technique and Gunns sweet-science bass playing, as  are strongpoints in one of the instrumentals featured in this "construKction", "Larks Tongues In Aspic, Part IV", the question youll ask yourself about the former is: "This guy was in Mr. Mister?!!?" Joining Crimson has matured Pats musicianship, immensely. This is well documented into "Coda: I Have A Dream" as well, with Belews garbled, fuzzy vocals wonderfully buried in the mix. Crimson shows they are not afraid to go out of the fire and "Into The Frying Pan" with spectacular and depth-defying precision. In summing up King Crimsons long history, which dates back to its humble beginnings to 1967, it is safe to say some of their works to a degree on paricular albums (ex: "In The Court of the Crimson King") are long-winded and hypnotically sleep-inducing (such as "The Dream and the Illusion" section of "Moonchild" from the above-listed title). None of these ingredients are contained in "The ConstruKction of Light", which makes for an eye and ear opening musical listening experience.

' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000003S1G	February 1, 2003	0	1	4.0	Almost Perfect King Crimson	 "Three of a Perfect Pair" finds King Crimson mixing their unique musical stylings together with an unbridled lyrical sensibility - this time from a more bluesy perspective than with earlier efforts. Gone are the "avant"-jazz type arpeggiations and psychological/"schizophrenic" observational type lyrics that were trademarks in previous efforts. But, that makes "ToaPP" a more enjoyable work filled with the unexpected. Then again, King Crimson has always been about experimenting with sensationally new ideas - bringing a fresh and unique approach to each and every recording. Different lineup changes through the years also confirms this fact. Lead singer Adrian Belews long-pause a cappella of She-e-e-e from the opening title track leads the way into Robert Fripps bluesy guitar augmentations, then the rest of the band joins in for a somewhat loose and tight-knit musical coda simultaneously. Most of the selections here combine lyrical strength from Belews lyrics with musical muscle, courtesy of the strong, homogenous rhythm section of Fripp, Tony Levin and Bill Bruford (w/the latter two on bass/stick synthesizer and drums, respectively). This rhythm section brings forth such awe-inspiring wonder in the instrumentals "Nuages (That Which Passes, Passes Like Clouds)" and on the rather elastic "Industry", which features some very fine bass/guitar/synthesizer/percussion mesmerizations. "Dig Me" displays a very loose, frenetic style, and finds itself switching directions for no apparent reason. "Man With An Open Heart" has radio-friendly vibes written all over it, but, it still has that Crimson-esque touch etched into it as well. "Sleepless" contains a remarkable Talking Heads-type semblance, complete with a David Byrne sound-alike vocalization from Adrian Belew - and with a country flavor too, something else thats new from Crimson. "No Warning" goes off on its own noteworthy tangent, while "Larks Tongues In Aspic, Part 3" contains some flashy, brilliant moments, only to be outdone by their "Part One" and "Part Two" predecessors from the classic "Larks Tongues In Aspic" album from 1973 itself. Sadly, "ToaPP" would close another musical chapter in the Crimson library, and is their last excursion of the 1980s. Yet more lineup changes would ensue for the 1990s and into the 2000s, although Fripp and Belew would remain on board during that time frame. Although both above immediate time periods would find KC exploring darker musical/lyrical alleys, "Three of a Perfect Pair" is Crimson playing good "progressive" blues, and with a tremendous feeling at that. Get the "King Crimson Blues" today!      ',nonspam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000002J20	January 3, 2003	2	4	5.0	These "Tales" evoke many "Wondrous Stories"!	 Yess "Tales From Topographic Oceans" will definitely go down in history as one of the most debateable (double) albums in rock music history, or, at least in the annals of progressive rock. Many avid Yes fans are quick to praise this double disc work a masterpiece - the best Yes ever did, while others point out that "Tales..." is an overly-flawed, ultra-bombastic disaster, or the worst album in Yes history, or, in the minds of most prog-heads, the worst "effort" to grace the prog-rock scene in the genres rather varied and storied history. Those who are apt to hate it, either have a short attention span, or they just dont appreciate good...make that GREAT music. And "TFTO" isnt just GREAT music...it exceeds boundaries of sheer GENIUSNESS and exudes BRILLIANCE. Here is a somewhat brief track-by-track synopsis of each of the four "movements": "THE REVEALING SCIENCE OF GOD: Dance of the Dawn": A down-to-earth, yet musically and lyrically breathtaking arrangement. The band starts off on the right foot, combining moving and soothing instrumentation, which segues nicely between time changes. Rick Wakemans keyboards are just awesomely dazzling - the highlight of this track. Steve Howe and newcomer Alan White provide a rather homogenous rhythm section (on lead guitar and drums, respectively) thoughout parts of this track as well. All in all, a very "revealing" and enchanting listen. "THE REMEMBERING: High The Memory": The circus-like calliope opening (courtesy of Wakeman) permeates this track, coupled with Howes acoutic-styled guitar playing. Chris Squires thumping bass adds a little something extra to this "excursion", but otherwise, the track as a whole comes off as being the least strong of the four, only to be saved by a tender and romantic vocal from Jon Anderson. Still worth tuning into, though. On to Disc #2... "THE ANCIENT: Giants Under the Sun": What can I say about this particular movement? It is the intro of Alan Whites and Chris Squires percussive introspections and "liquid" bass playing that makes this track for me. There are other audio delights to keep an ear out for as well, so stay tuned! "RITUAL: Nous Sommes Du Soleil": The final movement of this double-CD masterpiece is the most spine-tingling and profound music ever committed to record. A prime example is chillngly displayed at around the 14:20 mark, when Alan Whites chimes and Rick Wakemans mesmerizing keyboard/synthsizer pulsations reach their ultimate climax, which make a calming transition into Steve Howes soothing guitar crescendo towards the final minutes. Yes displays some upstanding bluesy/jazzy arpeggiations, which make sporadic appearances here, too. Now, if only Jon Anderson could work on pronouncing his French a little more properly! Overall, "TFTO" is one of Yes most introspective and brilliant masterworks to date, with "Close To The Edge" being a close second. If only those Yes naysayers would put their own shortcomings aside and give "Tales..." another careful listen, they might like what they hear...and they, too, would regard it as a work of pure musical and lyrical genius. Yes, folks, "Tales From Topographic Oceans" will cause your ears auditory system to experience spontaneous orgasms, so please be sure and listen with great caution!      ',spam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000002BMZ	December 17, 2002	0	0	4.0	Journey with a distinctive bubblegum flavor	 "Raised On Radio", an album which was released two years after Steve Perrys debut solo album (1984s "Street Talk") and three years after the last Journey album (1983s "Frontiers"), is a well-balanced blend of Perry stylings casually blended with the sharp-edged rock and roll craftsmanship Journey had been known for in prior outings. Although some die-hard fans of this supergroup are apt to rate "ROR" as a sellout effort (with all the Steve Perry ballads which show up on here), others are quick to accept this album for what it is: good old-fashioned rock and roll with a polished, artistic flair that doesnt compromise between flashy musical overbearings or unpretentious mish-mosh, which "Raised On Radio" doesnt fall into either category. It is the unique display of arrangements on "ROR" that give it a really spirited flavor - bubblegum, if you will. Jonathan Cain and Neal Schon bring a lot to the Journey musical core all through this fine effort, while Steve Perrys vocals are as razor-sharp as ever. It is the session work which adds a little something extra as well, featuring Randy Jacksons powerful bass playing. Aside from the hits featured here, such as "Girl Cant Help It", "Be Good To Yourself" and the major hit "Ill Be Alright Without You", there are also other hidden gems featured here, including "Suzanne", "Once You Love Somebody" and "Why Cant This Night Go On Forever", among a few others. It is these tracks which give "Raised On Radio" the perfect introspective "Positive Touch". Yes, Journey may have lost two of its main players (Ross Valory and Steve Smith) by the time "ROR" was recorded, but that shouldnt distract even the most die-hard Journey fan from giving it adequate listens. "Raised On Radio" will even grow on casual fans of this mega-group, making it one CD youll be "Happy To Give" this holiday season!      ',nonspam
' A103KNDW8GN92L	B000068W55	December 2, 2002	9	9	5.0	A perfect mix n match of various musical styles	 "It Aint Easy" is most likely the most veritable title in the Three Dog Night catalogue, as far as musical stylings go. The CD opens with a ballsy rocker titled "Woman", plus there are other finely laid-out rock arrangements as well. "Rock & Roll Widow" contains a beautifully textured mixture of Michael Allsups lead guitar and Jimmy Greenspoons rangey and dynamic keyboard playing - the perfect balance to the above track. The third and final rock composition, the Barry Mann/Cynthia Weil-penned "Good Time Living", has Chuck Negron, Danny Hutton & Cory Wells singing together in upstanding fashion, with a uniquely interwoven style of three part harmony which cant be found anywhere else on this planet. Hutton, Negron & Wells each contribute solo lead vocals on three tracks, with Negron contributing a teary-eyed vocal on the Randy Newman-penned "Cowboy", and with Hutton contributing an equally impressive vocal performance on the Elton John/Bernie Taupin written "Your Song". Although TDNs version of Eltons ballad entered the charts the same time as "The Master(s) Himself", Elton Johns version quickly reached Top 20 status before the TDN version slowly made it up the far reaches of the Billboard charts in December 1970/January 1971. What makes TDNs version of "Your Song" unique in its own special way, is the bluesy instrumental passages that the band craftfully put in place of the last omitted verse - a Three Dog Night trademark found in other TDN album non-singles. Wells makes excellent use of his gruff, soulful vocals on the other Newman-penned single "Mama Told Me (Not To Come)" - TDNs first number one single. The title track emits several bluesy pulsations that are all over the place, as well. Theres a special place in the guys heart for 1950s music too, as is the heir apparent in "Good Feeling (1957)". Theres a funny little story featured in the booklet of the double CD "Celebrate 1965-1975" collection, as Danny Hutton stated about this track: "We stuffed rags and paper into our mouths, ears and noses, trying to make the funniest noises we could." To this, Cory Wells stated: "That was the happiest moment I remember. I remember going home at 7:30 in the morning after we recorded it. I was up for days." After hearing "Good Feeling (1957)" the guys truly were enjoying themselves, as per Hutton and Wells above comments, and it shows. "Out In The Country" showcases a mixture of folk & rock influences put to good measure. So, to sum it all up, "It Aint Easy" makes for wholesome "easy listening" pleasure at that, which makes it essential for your all-important Three Dog Night collection. Although this title went out of print in the U.S. long ago, many of the selections found on "It Aint Easy" are also located on the "Celebrate..." collection mentioned above. Who knows how much longer this import of "IAE" will be made available to the public. You would be most wise to pick up a copy soon, otherwise itll be one "hard sell"! IN LOVING MEMORY: Joe (Schermie) Schermetzler (1946-2002). R.I.P. Thanks for many musical memories, Joe.      ',nonspam

In his rather fragile attempts to gain Sams attention, our desparate "geek" does everything in his power to get her to attend the school dance, but "The Geek"s plans fall on deaf ears. Sam has her sights set on the most popular guy in school, who, in turn, has other "babes" at his beckoned call as well. Although "Sixteen Candles" is a teenage coming of age film both written and directed by teen film impresario John Hughes, one would expect this to be both a comedy and a drama, but "SC" contains more of the latter than of the former. It still retains a grand heap of delightful Hughesian charm, nevertheless. Hughes would take that style of charm to the next level with his "The Breakfast Club", which truly made superstars out of both Ringwald and Hall (including the rest of the "Brat Pack" cast not mentioned). But, before both these above-noted actors joined this exclusive "Club", they really paid their dues with "Sixteen Candles", where both Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall cut their teeth quite sharply before moving on to future work, including a stop at an exclusive "Club", as mentioned previously. "Sixteen Candles" is definitely one for the ultimate John Hughes viewing experience, and all a wonderful thrill to see and hear (including other Hughes flicks such as "The Breakfast Club", "Ferris Buellers Day Off", "Planes, Trains and Automobiles", and more) for yourself! Live this experience today!      ',spam

The homely outlaws include Bob Kortman, Lou Meehan, Tom London, George Chesebro, and many more. Ken Maynard combined the charm and good looks of John Wayne with the stunt riding ability of Yakima Canutt (the best ever cowboy stuntman).  Maynard was a professional stunt rider before becoming a silent movie star, and easily made the transition to talkies.  Only Maynard was able to compete on equal terms with both Tom Mix in the silents and John Wayne in the talkies.  Ken was so muscular and bowlegged, and had such damaged knees that he could hardly run.   The beautiful Verna Hille plays second fiddle to Ken Maynards only true love, his horse Tarzan.  Modern movie goers remember Trigger, but Tarzan was certainly the most talented horse in the movies and the most loved by his owner, Ken Maynard.   This was the highest grossing western serial ever released.  It was meant for matinee audiences, which were mostly kids.  So expect a kids film.   I see than Amazon also carries "Six Shootin Sheriff."  It was one of Kens last pictures and a favorite of mine.  Ken has to clean out 3 tough outlaw gangs and makes the supreme sacrifice.  He has to pass of a piece of pie made by his girl, Miss Mollie.  Hes afraid itll slow him down too much, because bad man Earl Dwire is waiting to gun him down in front of the saloon.   "Two Gun Man" is another great Maynard movie.  If youre a handgun shooter, youll love the insane way Kens partner teaches some cowhands how to shoot.  Dont miss this one. "In Old Santa Fe." is also not only real good but real famous.  Maynard is teamed with Gabbie Hayes; and Gene Autry and Smiley Burnett make their first singing appearance in the movies.

Leach wrote the book; Morrison only wrote the two-page introduction.  Leach tends to be a little "politically correct" but in generally he gives us an unbiased history.  This is an interesting book and Ive just finished rereading after a 10-year gap.  It is still interesting.   This was an amazing war between Puritans, who were would poorly equipped in nearly every way, against Indians who would were born and raised in warfare.   For many months the Whites lost virtually all the battles.  King Philips war was one of desperate sieges of tiny garrisons and ambushes of those Whites trying to rescue those besieged.   Just when you think the Whites are about to get the upper hand, the Indians attack new targets and the Whites are losing again.  The most amazing thing is that the colonists had not one English soldier or ship to help them.  They raised and equipped their own little militia companies.  Unlike some other Indian wars that only had a few battles, this little war had dozens if not hundreds of little battles.   The Indian was as well armed with flintlocks, as was the White.  In this war, the Indian was far superior in tactics and he was never beaten when he could fight his guerrilla style warfare.  This was the Indians last chance to push the White man into the sea.  Providence (Rhode Island) was nearly destroyed and the Indian raided the towns adjacent to Boston.   Town after town was destroyed.   I think this book is a little superior to Schultzs "King Philips War," which is a little bit too PC.  But both are well worth reading.      ',nonspam

Then came the big bad honkies with their diseases, guns and "total warfare."   Malone takes bits of information and constructs them in is to history.  He finds an obscure record of a White who got in trouble with White authorities for selling a defective gun to an Indian.  Obviously the Indian knew the gun was defective, claims Malone, he was just buying for parts and we can assume he was a technological genius. Worse is that the book gives of very little information on the skulking tactics and technology of the Indians.   For example, the Indian of was a master of deceit and subterfuge but Malone avoids that topic like a plague.   The Puritans won the war because of more men and virtually unlimited supplies, according only to Malone.  Other authors such as Schultz (King Philips War) and Leach (Flintlock and Tomahawk) tell us that the colonists were short of nearly everything, couldnt get their crops in, and faced starvation.  Certainly the colonists had a larger population but fielded smaller army.  The books by Leach and Schulz remain the only two good recent histories. Researchers can use Malones book for its references.  And its worth reading for those taking more than a casual interest in the 1775-1776 King Phillips War.      ',nonspam

Theirs was a war of skill, courage, and sheer will  against an endless, unremitting tide of the Allies personnel and  machinery. All 27 are covered in Knights: Panzer commanders, U-boat  captains, combat generals, Hans Rudel (the Stuka pilot), and fighter  pilots.  Fighter pilots included Adolf Galland, Werner M lders, Gordon  Gollob, Hermann Graf (200 kills in 13 months), Erich Hartmann (353 kills in  30 months), and Heinz Wolfgang Schnaufer.  Called the "Night Ghost" by the  British bomber crews, Schnaufer shot down 4 bombers a night for 5  consecutive nights and once destroyed 5 bombers in 14  minutes. Hans-Joachim Marseille was known by his friends as the "Southern  Star."  This lone fighter preferred to attack an entire squadron of  Spitfires (at least 5) with his single aircraft.   He never completed a  sortie without a kill and often got all five enemies.  The British had  standing orders not to engage the wild but chivalrous warrior they called  the "Eagle of Africa."  He died in a 1942 aircraft accident with 158 kills.   He was 22.

The other books are not objective and they just  repeat the semi-truths and outright falsehoods that circulate in the  controlled news media rather than doing original research, which is what  Dobratz and Shanks-Meile did. This book is primarily descriptive.  It  tells the history of the "movement" and describes todays major  groups and leaders, who they are, what they believe, and what they do.  The  authors give an unbiased account of the FBIs and AFTs wars against Whites  --  Gordon Kahl, Ruby Ridge, and Bob Matthews Silent Brotherhood -- as  well as the FBIs illegal and underhanded war against the Klan and other  White groups.   It does have a few dry parts where these two professors  describe how the movement fits into Sociologys theories.  Dobratz and  Shanks-Meile dont seem to understand that the White movement is a  biological struggle for survival and not a sociological movement.

' A103U0Q3IKSXHE	1570627401	April 27, 2006	0	1	5.0	On the road to consciousness . . .	 This is the second book I have read of the many that Ken Wilber has produced. I admit to struggling with the concept he is presenting, but that has nothing to do with his writing which is clear and concise. I suppose it speaks to where I am, presently, in evolving my own consciousness.  Wilber employed a question and answer format with this volume and it worked well for me. The "interviewer" posed questions and Wilber answered them. This comfortably leads the reader through the maze of human consciousness development as Wilber sees it. Beginning with his concept of the "Kosmic Pattern" of the twenty connectors, Wilber winds his way to higher levels of consciousness using the concept of holons.  I have no difficulty following the holon metaphor in the "material world" view. Its very straight forward - particles combined to make atom holons. Atoms combined to make molecule holons. Molecules make cell holons, etc. If we destroy a holon, then we destroy all holons "above" it. Without molecules, we and much of the physical world as we know it simply goes away. This is not a difficult concept.  Applying this concept to human consciousness (not the physical body which of course we can understand comprises cell holons of many different types) is where I struggle. Wilber states that "So even a person born into a grand and glorious and global vision-logic culture nevertheless begins development at the physiocentric, then biocentric, then egocentric levels, then moves to the sociocentric levels, then moves to the postconventional and woldcentric levels. There is no way to avoid or circumvent that general process." This then leads to the concept that therefore, we cannot, as we achieve higher level of consciousness, denigrate or "kill off" the earlier stages of consciousness. Wilber posits that each stage of development becomes the basis for the next holon level. To destroy a holon at one level would presumably destroy all "higher" holons.  In terms of a discussion of religion or other human institutions, this implies that we will forever be subject to fellow beings who remain "stuck at one level or another" and all that that implies for the human condition. We cannot short-circuit the development. Of course there is hope that as long as we understand the process, we can ease people through it by perhaps inculcating keeping an open mind, as much as possible, at each stage. The drive to understand that "there is something beyond my present view" may keep us skeptical or agnostic enough to allow progress to higher consciousness.  I am still trying to wrap my mind around all that Wilbers model means to humanity. There is a part of me that feels as though we are doomed to lower levels of awareness and consciousness because we all "have to start at square one." On the other hand, I have much hope that if we can only embrace this model, we will recognize that wherever we are on the path, we have more consciousness to achieve. We cant begin this hard work unless we at least seriously consider what Wilber has to say. Must read for any sentient being who aspires to higher levels of consciousness and understanding.

' A103U0Q3IKSXHE	0374292884	February 28, 2006	1	2	5.0	The Flat World and the Frog . . .	 I thought Thomas L. Friedman had done a superb job with his book The Lexus and The Olive Tree, and he did. But Friedman has hit yet another home run with The World is Flat as it picks up where The Lexus and The Olive Tree left off. I will be thinking about, rereading, referring to, and quoting this book a great deal in the future. I am impressed with the thought process and research as well as the trademark Friedman talent for taking a huge, complex subject and making it accessible and interesting.  The major sections of the book are laid out in logical fashion: How the World Became Flat; America and the Flat World; Developing Countries and the Flat World; Companies and the Flat World; Geopolitics and the Flat World; and Conclusion - Imagination. Friedman makes a solid case for his view, recognizes the limitation of that world view, and argues strongly for what needs to be done to live in this new world. But what strikes me most is how this phenomenon of the Flat World has crept up on so many people. It seems a bit like the old proverb about the frog and boiling water - Put a frog in boiling water and it will immediately jump out. Put a frog in cool water and slowly bring it to a boil and he will sit there and perish (not true, but we get the point). And so it may well be with the Flat World about which Friedman tries to warn us. We could slowly boil to death in the heat of global competition not well understood.  Because my career has always been in and around the leading edge of technology, much of what Friedman had to say surprised me from the point of view of "this is not news - where have you been?" But what was enlightening to me was his view of what the results and secondary effects were from the steady march of technology and the Flattening World. Like many, I didnt often look too far past the immediate effect of supplying what customers demanded for products and innovation.  One of the most important issues raised in this excellent book is put forth in chapter seven, "The Quiet Crisis." Here, Friedman makes the case for why we in America had better understand the ramifications of the Flat World and get our act together with respect to education. Outside of the education profession, most everyone seems to agree that there is a crisis of performance in education. It has now reached our secondary and tertiary levels because the foundations are not being properly taught in earlier years. We do not agree on the solution to the problems, but we do seem to have a consensus that there is in fact a problem. What Friedman has to say should make us all realize that this is truly a crisis and not just a back burner issue. Foreign students educated in the United States have no reason to stay here and contribute to our countrys wellbeing. They can now collaborate from home almost as easily, and give back to their own countries.  The World is Flat should be required reading for all of us regardless of our profession, world view, political persuasion, or religious bent. The world is getting flatter every day and it will affect us all regardless of what we might wish. This process is inevitable, so we might as well understand it and figure out how to work with the changing reality. If we ignore this problem only to complain, we will boil in a horrible stew of our own making.      ',spam
' A103U0Q3IKSXHE	0976385406	February 28, 2006	1	1	4.0	Myth busters for your Sales Team	 A colleague afforded me the honor of reviewing his new book prior to publication. Don McNamara and I have gotten to known each other over the past four years through several professional organizations - The Association of Professional Consultants, the Institute of Management Consultants, The Professional Speakers Association, and our own Mastermind Group. My own background includes extensive periods of time in sales leadership positions in some of the worlds largest semiconductor companies. Based on my experiences in sales as well as other functions within these organizations, I can heartily endorse the work McNamara has done in this new book.  The subtitle for this book is "How Senior Executives Erase Status Quo Myths and Build Superior Sales Organizations." McNamara then goes on to present ten typical myths surrounding the sales functions in many (if not all) organizations. These myths, if you buy into them, will indeed manage to hold back your organizations growth and evolution. McNamara explains in a clear, straight-from-the-shoulder style exactly how each Myth manifests itself in an organization, what business processes aid and abet the Myth, and how to break out of the destructive pattern.  This book is not a "how to sell" book. Bookstore shelves are filled to overflowing with many such books. Instead, McNamara points to the critical issue of how the sales function is viewed by and integrated into a healthy company. Properly aligning the sales function (or Demand Generation as some companies refer to the sales function) is critical to our success in the new global economy, and this book will provide a good starting point for a comprehensive program of change initiation and management. It is likely that your company, as a whole, does not suffer from ALL ten of these Myths; yet I am willing to wager that all ten are represented by individual leaders within your company. And some of these Myths are known to many sales leaders who have simply not figured out how to change the status quo. Reading and understanding the ten sales Myths and implementing remedial actions found in Visionary Sales Leadership will better position your company for the hyper-competitive ever changing global market of the new world.

' A103U0Q3IKSXHE	1570628556	January 24, 2006	3	3	5.0	A different World View . . .	 Read and struggle with this book. Then go deeper - Wilbur is a challenge.  I have long been a student of human evolution, science, and spirituality. Finally, I discovered Ken Wilbur and began reading with one of his latest books, A Theory of Everything (T.O.E.). I was amazed at how this all rang true for me, and how it applies to our personal as well as professional lives.  This is not an easy read. I found myself having to go back over material already read and rethink it for myself. But the exercise is well worth it. Wilbur starts with the statement that "We live in an extraordinary time: all of the worlds cultures, past and present, are to some degree available to us, either in historical records or as living entities." From there, he develops his theory of everything, which by his own definition "any truly integral vision or T.O.E. will have to reconcile, one way or another, the relation of science and religion." By the end of this book, Wilbur has made a fairly solid argument for having accomplished just that.  I have to admit that my fairly structured mind had to be jarred out of its normal mode of world view, but once I got by my own mental hurdles, T.O.E. made a great deal of sense to me. Beginning with Don Becks Spiral of Development, Wilbur extends that work to eventually become an all inclusive model for second-tier consciousness - and beyond. Besides my own limitations, one of the more difficult issues in reading this text was the extensive use of endnotes, requiring much flipping back and forth between the appendix and the text.  There are several ideas I find disheartening though. ". . . there will always be a large population of humanity at the magic and mythic waves, which are usually associated with traditional religion. Thus, traditional religious beliefs will never completely go away because everybody is born at square one." And a second disheartening statement is that "Those who had hoped that we were rid of all that silly religious stuff are probably in for a rocky ride." While I understand his point, I still find it deeply disturbing that we will always be starting at "square one." I hope this proves not to be true in a practical sense, even if it is technically the case. I hope we can somehow short circuit the normally long educational process to get to second-tier consciousness. We are able to do that with many other of our "new world views," and so hope springs eternal.   A second disturbing realization for me is that I must rethink my world view of the "interdependent web of all existence of which we are a part." The consequences of Wilburs T.O.E. is the requirement that I now recognize that "it is NOT true that human minds (the noosphere) are part of nature (or the biosphere), but rather the reverse."  Live and learn. If you wish to challenge your own world view, this book is a great place to start. You can also learn more at Ken Wilburs Personal Web Site.      ',spam
' A103U0Q3IKSXHE	1889150339	January 24, 2006	2	2	3.0	Corporate politics in a new light . . .	 This book was recommended by a colleague, CEO of a manufacturing company, with whom I do some exponential thinking from time to time. I can see why he enjoyed reading this straightforward look at internal corporate politics. Miller builds a new model for understanding what is sometimes a very perplexing problem - decoding why people respond the way they do in a given situation.  What I found interesting in Millers model is that he requires us to "look at ourselves" as part of the stress delivery system in the organization. "If a situation is making you anxious, then theres a question in there somewhere that is yours alone to answer." Miller explains how we all set up triangles to get our way or to spread out the anxiousness so that we dont have so much to handle ourselves. "Learning to manage your own behavior in triangles is probably the single most important thing you can learn about handling workplace politics." So I found this model for understanding why smart companies do smart things to be useful.  What makes the book very readable is the use of stories to illustrate the points being made. The stories are familiar to anyone who has worked in or around large organizations. The layout of the book is also helpful in that each chapter ends with a summary of the major points made. Millers book is a worthwhile quick read.      ',nonspam
' A103U0Q3IKSXHE	1591840090	December 29, 2005	1	1	4.0	Exponential Thinking	 Peter Senge said it best: "Today there are two types of leaders in business: those who dont know everything they need to and those who dont recognize it . . . The Third Opinion is for everyone who knows that they need help making critical decisions and for those whose friends may need to bring it to their attention."  Dr. Joni has provided the research that shows why we can benefit from the power of many. Her research showed a surprising level of isolation at the top of our organizations. "While some leaders find a way to build trusted leadership circles that integrate outside insight and have a few confidants, many are on the other end of the spectrum and only experience greater isolation with each move up the leadership ladder." The background for this research is that the 21st century has drastically changed leadership requirements for our organization. This new paradigm requires new thinking - exponential thinking. It also requires three new habits: the habit of mind, the habit of relationships and the habit of focus.  Exponential thinking comprises six steps: Understanding our own mental models that guide our thinking, Developing our ability to discern patterns, Check and Recheck our hidden assumptions, Create varied scenarios of the future, Look for ways to broaden our line of sight, and Invest in our ability to think in the gray spaces. "Exponential thinking allows you to see all sides of a complex issue; its the process of examining context, looking for interrelationships, exploring assumptions, and asking questions that reveal the full truth and potential of a situation, like a prism revealing the full spectrum of color within white light." Exponential thinking is best done with others.  Dr. Joni logically explains how these keys - the three habits and exponential thinking - applies to emerging leaders, key leaders and senior leaders in our organizations. Using some tried and true tools to understand our management style, and that of others, we can place ourselves in the organizations structure. Then, armed with a tool she developed, the Star of Complexity Map, we can discover where our growing edges are and work to fill those gaps with trusted third opinions.   This book has helped me explain the minor explosion of CEO groups forming. Independent thinkers, trusted colleagues join together to work on each others business and even personal issues. Vistage International (formerly The Executive Committee) is one such organization. Membership has grown from 11,000 CEOs worldwide to more than 12,000 members in 15 countries. Why do busy executives take time for such meetings? The answer is they have learned the power of exponential thinking, even if they call it something else. This is a must read book for anyone aspiring to leadership in our organizations.      ',nonspam
' A103U0Q3IKSXHE	006073132X	November 29, 2005	8	11	5.0	The hidden side of everything . . .	 This book is simply astounding. Some of the conventional wisdom and old standby principles to live by are either totally shattered or are at least called into question by this very challenging book.  Once I started reading Freakonomics, I found it difficult to put down. Not only is it written in a casual style that keeps you easily moving from one page to the next, but it draws the reader in with off the wall questions like; "What do school teachers and Sumo Wrestlers have in common?" The authors then take us through the beauty of incentives, as well as their dark side - cheating!  My personal favorite is the study on parenting. Many of my most cherished beliefs about parenting were dashed - Im not nearly as important to shaping my children as I thought I was. This became both a let down and a relief. The implication for our culture is significant and we should not ignore those implications when formulating or evaluating policy in public life.  Other questions Levitt asked and then explored were "How is the Ku Klux Klan like a Group of Real-Estate Agents?, "Why do drug dealers still live with their moms?," and perhaps most controversial is "Where have all the criminals gone?" in which Levitt explores the unintended consequences of abortion.  This is a dazzling, engaging book and one that teaches us to remember that "if morality represents how people would like the world to work, then economics shows how it actually does work." I learned why the conventional wisdom is so often wrong, how experts bend the facts to meet their own world view, and that "freakonomics" can shed light on the real world.      ',spam
' A103U0Q3IKSXHE	0471463302	November 29, 2005	4	4	4.0	Effective change management . . .	 Im honored to have received a couple of books for review from Wiley publishing. Influence without Authority by Allan Cohen and David Bradford (second edition) is a classic. Between the covers of this book are not only ideas about the art of getting work done through people, but a host of useful case studies and resources.  One of my first major change management projects, some 12 years ago now, lead me to believe that there had to be a better way to accomplish the cross functional negotiations that need to happen in any major change initiative. Here, in this book, are the explanations for both what worked and what didnt work on that project. Many of the principles listed not only got my head nodding "yes!" but also help me to understand how the hard learned lessons over the past 12 years fit into the overall picture of influencing colleagues, clients, and their employees.  The Cohen-Bradford Model of Influence, while appearing simple, was a bit more difficult to really comprehend. It comprises six "steps" pictured as an inward spiral, and starts at the "outside" with "Assume all are potential allies." Then moves inward with "Clarify your goals and priorities," "Diagnose the world of the other person," "Identify relevant currencies, theirs, yours," "Dealing with relationships," and finally at the center "Influence through give and take." Essentially, this text deals with explaining how this model is applied in a practical manner. Most important is the concept that while for small things, we can and often do intuitively understand the give and take in a transaction, for large complex transactions we need to be more methodical and think through our process, goals, interests and those of our allies. Hence, the model.   Of particular interest to me was this texts recognition that organizational change can be very complicated, and so dedicated several chapters to that process alone. Between these chapters, the case studies providing real life examples, and yes, the model itself, this book is invaluable to those either in or consulting to organizations wanting to move forward - because that means managing complex change and the need to influence people as well as leading them.

At first I didnt really connect Carlson with the book I had just finished reading prior to the workshop. About an hour into the meeting I realized that the speaker was advocating some of the very principles from the book that I had so heavily marked up and reread several times.  What a delight! And what hard work - Carlson walks the talk, and he definitely put us through our paces. And this book will do the same for those who take the time to read it. Beneath the Armor is filled with straight forward talk about the leaders at the top of Business. At the end of each chapter is a review and a list of actions to take based on the information we just read. It is a practical, put it to work book for CEOs.  Chapter titles give us an idea of the clarity this book will bring to the serious leader: 1. Be Authentic - it is easier to Remember; 2. Take Care of Yourself First - then others; 3. Lead the Organization - Let Other Manage it; 4. Value Resiliency over Brilliancy; 5. It is All About the People; 6. Understanding Your Numbers is Not Optional; and 7. Have a Well-Lubricated Reverse Gear. Written in deceptively easy and conversational style, each chapter turns out to be chock full of solid strategy and finishes with a call to action. Reading this book did in fact change the direction of my consultancy.  More importantly, this book in conjunction with spending four days in a workshop with Ole Carlson changed my life - for the better. This is a must read for leaders and those who coach and/or consult with business leaders. To quote Mr. Carlson, "The message in this book comes from you and your peers and I am simply paying it forward."      ',nonspam

Reeves  Im always interested in learning more about my profession. Every day I find that I am both adding value at my clients and at the same time being humbled by how much I still have  to learn about governance, ethics process, organizational development, and managing organizational change. On rare occasions I have learned something valuable and practical from books, but that is an exception. Such an exciting exception occurred when I was asked to review Dr. Douglas Reeves book. What a delight and surprise!   Its All About the Client is written in a clear and professional voice with many first hand accounts of actual client engagements. Yet, while entertaining and interesting to read, this book is full of textbook quality practical ideas, procedures, charts, and forms. Reeves has perfectly balanced these often mutually exclusive styles, and the take-away applications for you consulting practice from this "how to" manual are many indeed.  From busting the "Myth of Balance" (lets face it, if you love what you do, you will spend as much time as possible doing it!) to the ever practical "Its not about you, its all about the client," Reeves dispenses sound advice for both those hiring consultants and the consulting firm itself. His no nonsense approach to the issues confronting consultants is refreshing and obviously comes from years of experience. The reader learns what to consider when deciding between staying a sole practitioner and building an organization - with no holds barred. Reeves gives us practical advice for aligning our time with our mission, along with the practical forms used to track how we spend our time. And the appendix is chock-full of additional practical outlines for engagement, task prioritization, etc.  Dr. Reeves has successfully distilled years of experience in building his consulting practice into accessible and invaluable advice for consultants in particular and business people in general. I believe this to be the single most important and practical book of the many I have read on the consulting profession. Reading this book will give the committed consultant confidence that done well, his or her chosen work has meaning and purpose.      ',spam
' A103U0Q3IKSXHE	0791445631	November 26, 2000	21	23	5.0	Give it up!	 Through his book, Mr. Griffin has helped me answer one of the big questions that has bothered me since my undergraduate years in Electrical Engineering - how to resolve my sense of mystery in the world around me with my understanding and appreciation of the scientific method of inquiry. In a nutshell, the answer is that both Science and Religion have to give up some long held beliefs and dogmatic statements of "fact." Put succinctly;  "Belief in the supernatural causes problems for religion it can not solve, and supernaturalism makes religion incompatible with science. For both reasons, religion needs to give it up."  "Belief in materialism causes problems for science it can not solve, and materialism makes science incompatible with religion. For both reasons, science needs to give it up."  In addition to the views on resolution of this de facto conflict between religion and science, Mr. Griffins book has shed a considerable amount of light on my meager understanding of Alfred North Whiteheads writings around what I refer to as Process Theology. It has encouraged me to study further my own philosophy and theology and to explore how it fits with my understanding of the material world. As a technologist, it seems imperative for me to clearly understand this issue if for no other reason than to have a sound basis for ethical conduct in our increasingly technology dependent society. So to that end, this book is must reading for all of us, since we will all have to make ethical decisions about advancement in technology from creation of "spiritual machines," to genetic manipulation.

Complete with a reading list, this book will be a useful resource for the aspiring writer for years to come. Some simple rules are put forth: "If you dont have time to read, you dont have the time or the tools to write" and "Put your desk in the corner, and every time you sit down there to write, remind yourself why it isnt in the middle of the room. Life isnt a support-system for art. Its the other way around." Like one of his fiction novels, this book keeps you running from page to page. It begins with a fascinating account of Mr. Kings childhood, and before you know it, youre in the middle of "how to write." At the end, after we are quite firmly on the hook, we get the lesson on editing. Ruthless editing. Mr. King shows us how to follow the 10% rule, that is, 2nd draft = 1st draft - 10%. We are given the detailed explanation for each of the editing changes, and it serves to drive home each of the clear lessons given throughout the book. It is an excellent summary section, and one that can serve as an example for any writer (or editor). In short, a necessary addition to an bookshelf.      ',nonspam

Natalie comes through in this book. We know her and what drives her after reading this selection. The fact that we also learn something about her craft is almost secondary. Some may think we also learn more about Natalie than we need or want to, but if you think so,  then perhaps the point is missed. It is from our panexperiential existence that we draw meaning for life and Natalie teaches us how to translate that experience to the written word.  She does so not only by overt instruction, but by covert story telling all at once. Here books on writing definitely need to be on any writers shelf for frequent reference.      ',nonspam

He spoke on the real meaning of the word charisma, and how we pretty much misuse it today. We frequently use the word to mean someone who is a good speaker, or presenter. But the meaning of the word, to Mr. Smith, goes much deeper than that. He posits that there are at least three levels of "charismatic speakers." The first level is accessible to many individuals who take the time to master the principles of persuasive speaking. The second level of charisma is more difficult to achieve because it requires a speaker to be "authentic," by which Mr. Smith means they know who they are and they take responsibility for their actions and what they advocate. And the third level of charismatic speaker reaches beyond the material world to associate in some way with the metaphysical, the transcendent, the spiritual, or some other form of perfection. Mr. Smith then goes on to give examples of each of these levels of charismatic persons, drawing from history and our understanding of historic figures such as Socrates, Plato, Jesus, Buddha, and Augustine. This text is one every public speaker and/or clergy should read and understand.      ',nonspam

Im not at all sure what this new "format" is supposed to accomplish, but this is the second book Ive read that did not use quotation marks and I find it disconcerting. It was as if I kept passing beautiful landscapes or scenic rest areas and had to stop and go back to really enjoy the views. It seemed to me to be a waste of energy and a source of frustration just like driving in  an unfamiliar town where the street signs are obliterated or missing.     Still, once used to the terrain, I was able to appreciate the marvelous scenes unfolding in Holt. The people became real and their stories were that of middle American life. Their problems, concerns, and interactions were familiar, not fake or contrived. Heroes lost fights, good people made mistakes and normally thoughtful, caring people did thoughtless, careless things.     The values of individuals and the community can be discerned as we watch Ike and Bobby grow up. We see the work ethic as they deliver papers before school and their father takes over for them when they are out of town. We learn of human values of compassion as the McPheron brothers take in Victoria Roubideaux and give her a safe environment in which to live. We are witness to living, loving, and dying and the manner in which these rites of passage are received by the new friends in Holt.     Plainsong is the song of middle America. It is told in engaging detail, helping us feel at home in Holt. The characters are revealed to us over time, and eventually, we know just about the whole community. No wonder this was a New Yorker Book Award finalist. Well worth the read.      ',spam

This book  belongs on the shelf right along side Kurzweil, Norman and Metcalfe. It  will round out our comprehension of the future, both near and farther out  on the horizon. 	I learned about PEM three-dimensional printers and how  they will help us model our ideas. I learned about the all too easy use of  buzzwords such as "fuzzy logic" to confuse the public into  thinking something "new" is happening. I learned a great new  definition for religion-"Beliefs about our existence that are not  falsifiable have a central place in human experience-theyre called  religion." And I learned about a great place for students of all  backgrounds to work together for fun and maybe even profit-the Media labs  at MIT. 	And I found an answer to a question that has long been  bothering me. "Marvin Minsky believes that the study of artificial  intelligence failed to live up to its promise, not because of any lack of  intelligence in the programs or the programmers, but because of the limited  life experience of a computer that cant see, or hear, or move."

It is amazing how Mr. Bohjalian was able to put into writing the feelings of women during childbirth. Certainly it is difficult enough to express those feelings, but to do so as a man  shows an incredible amount of compassion and understanding. A lesson to us  all, Im sure. 	This is a tightly written novel concerning a normally  safe home birth gone terribly wrong, and how it affects the lives of all  those involved. It twists and turns and leads the reader to wrong  assumptions over and over again. At the same time it manages to bring forth  the mystery and wonder of life, and especially the moment of birth. The  novel is written from the point of view of the Midwifes daughter, who is,  at the time of the writing, a doctor, specifically an OB/GYN. Armed with  first hand knowledge as well as her mothers copious notes, Constance spins  the story of her mothers passion for midwifery, devotion to her trade, and  tragic loss of that love after the death of one of her mothers. 	The  trial scenes are wonderfully exciting and maddening at the same time. But  more important is the story of love and support in the Danforth family,  though not without its stress and misunderstandings. And Constance tells  her own story of growing up and through the tragedy of the public trial,  her mothers too close relationship with her lawyer, and her fathers  struggle to understand and support his wife.

Here is a book to help with that quest. Sveiby explains  that, as an example, the public was willing to pay, in 1995, an average  price of $70 for Microsoft when their book value was about $7. In other  words, the shareholders saw about $9 of additional value for every $1 of  tangible assets on Microsofts books. There is no entry on Microsofts  balance sheet for that $9, and it represents a major trend in our  "post industrial" economy. How do we manage such an illusive  asset? 	Sveiby steps us through (1) understanding the era of knowledge  Organizations, (2) managing intangible assets, and (3) measuring intangible  assets. There are practical examples of measuring systems, how to organize  a company to maintain and transfer knowledge, and keys to developing  professional competence. 	Sveiby defines, for the purpose of this book,  knowledge as "a capacity to act." "Ones capacity to act is  created continuously by a process-of-knowing. In other words, it is  contextual. Knowledge cannot be separated from its context. The notion also  implies teleological purpose. I believe that the human process-of-knowing  is designed by nature to help us survive in an often hostile  environment." 	I learned about the professionals three life  cycles - the super star, the statesman, and the normal professional. I  learned about the classic problem of organic growth in our knowledge  organizations. And I re-learned that "it takes time, experience, and  mental effort to turn information into useful knowledge. And since  recipients cannot know until afterward whether it was worth spending that  time, information that turns out to be worthless is really worth less than  nothing." 	For those trying to understand the new business model,  this book is well worth the time and effort. It will help you move your  company into the modern age.      ',nonspam

Lamott, through witty, humorous, clear, concise writing and compelling stories shows us how, in many ways, we are our own worst enemies. But she also shows us ways out of the problems we  create and gives us a glimpse of how our attitudes and perseverance can  overcome even the problems of alcoholism, drugs, being a single Mom, and  being poor. 	On the surface, this is a very self-centered book,  focused almost entirely on the feelings, friends, enemies, and weaknesses  of the author. Yet, Lamott manages to use her story to demonstrate to us  that through love and faith, one can overcome seemingly insurmountable  odds. If one reads these stories while keeping compassion in his or her  heart for another suffering human being, then a spiritual journey unfolds  with many wonderful lessons along the way. But it takes work to get by the  feeling that were learning far more about the author than we needed to. 	  Yet Traveling Mercies becomes a wonderful sermon since it afflicts the  comfortable and gives some hope and comfort to the afflicted. And perhaps  the discomfort one feels when reading it is the same as that of being  around sick family members or friends. And how can one tell the story of  love and compassion for others bringing grace into ones life without  sounding self-centered and a bit self-righteous? In the end, Lamott does  precisely that. The reader grows respect and admiration for this frail  human being as she tells of her own spiritual journey from someone who  could not stand being "in the same room with a Christian," to  someone who can lean on God and accept Jesus. And she does so without  trashing anyone elses faith system.  	"I make him [her son, go  to church] because I can. I outweigh him by nearly seventy-five pounds.   But that is only part of it. The main reason is that I want to give him  what I found in the world, which is to say a path and a little light to see  by. Most of the people I know who have what I want--which is to say,  purpose, heart, balance, gratitude, joy--are people with a deep sense of  spirituality. They are people in community, who pray, or practice their  faith; they are Buddhists, Jews, Christians--people banding together to  work on themselves and for human rights. They follow a brighter light than  the glimmer of their own candle; they are part of something  beautiful." 	I spoke of this book to a minister friend, and  recommended it as good reading. He in turn mentioned it to a friend who was  having difficulty with a wayward daughter. The daughter read Traveling  Mercies and reported back that it had changed her life. That she was able  to see how to get things back into control. Perhaps that is the only  recommendation this book needs. It changes peoples lives for the better.      ',nonspam

His story, the story of the Congo, and his familys stories are told in turn by his  wife and daughters. In the end, Africa transforms not only the meager  possessions that the Price family brought to the Congo, but each of the  family members themselves. Nathan and his unforgiving, uncompromising,  and uncomprehending brand of religion only survives as long as he does  because of the quiet compassion of the villagers in Kilanga. In the end, he  changes nothing of significance there and winds up being killed because of  his religion induced blindness.

Through tragedy, she grows to  understand the mistaken attempts to save those poor souls in Africa, who in  then end need no outside saviors.  Rachel Price, is the oldest daughter  and self-centered teenage product of the relatively affluent America. Her  major concern is for her own looks and getting out of Africa to go back to  her parties and easy life. She too is a survivor. But, as luck would have  it, winds up staying in Africa and becoming a successful businesswoman. She  never does understand her younger twin sisters who are both more observant  and intellectually competent than Rachel will ever be. Leah Price is the  "normal" twin, ever guilty for perhaps causing her sister to be  crippled, and ever on the watch to please father. Yet it is she who grows  independent enough to actually stand up to the tyrant. It is she who  becomes the tomboy and feminist of the Price women. It is she who comes to  love Africa and Anatole (her African husband and father of her children),  and it is she who chooses to stay and help the people in any way she  can. Adah Price is Leahs crippled twin and, like Leah, intelligent  beyond her years. She suffers from hemiplegia, which seems to give her  special insight into the way things are. She takes comfort in her own  silence and uses her affliction to the best advantage. Adah is my favorite  character because of her clear understanding of her father, their plight,  the lives of the people of Kilanga, and where she fits in the world. Her  understanding is not perfect, but it grows in time as she observes more in  her own backward/forward way. Adah overcomes her hemiplegia and eventually  becomes a successful biomedical researcher. Ruth May Price is the baby of  the family. She is a wonderful, prescient child who is the first to make  friends with the children of Kilanga. She is headstrong, persistent, and  constantly pushing the limits. In the end, it is she who suffers not only  from her own actions, but from the unforgiving Congo. Thus the Price  family represents a cross-section of America in foreign affairs. Nathan is  the self-righteousness of a rich and successful people who cannot see the  virtues of a different culture and who recklessly impose unworkable  solutions to perceived problems. Orleanna is the compliant "my country  right or wrong" patriot of the masses who only rebels when it is  perhaps too late. Rachel is the spoiled middle-class caring only about  achieving and maintaining a comfortable life regardless of the world  consequences. Adah represents the best intentions of our technology to  bring relief to a suffering world, but still at arms length. Leah stands in  for those who, out of guilt and recognition of wrong doing, actually try to  bring about small steps on the path to progress that fit the culture of the  wronged. And Ruth May is like all those innocent children who are harmed  from neglect or misguided adults in pursuit of their selfish adult  goals. And in the weaving of the Price family story, we learn a great  deal about the Congos fight for independence from Belgium. As each of the  women tell their stories, in their own words, misspellings, and prejudices,  the characters of the other family members and friends becomes a bit more  complete, along with the story of the struggle of a people yearning to be  free from foreign rule. The journey matters, and Barbara Kingsolver takes  us on a compelling journey in The Poisonwood Bible. I enjoyed this book  even more on my second reading.      ',nonspam

The Dalai Lamas wonderful optimism shines forth as he paints a picture of civilization of compassion and true love for our  fellow humans. 	But this is not a hollow sermon with only the hope of  peace held out in front of us. It is instead a prescription for beginning  the long journey toward converting ourselves to fuller, happier human  beings. Through personal stories and experiences the Dalai Lama shows us  the way to re-think our position in the world. 	Despite protestations  to the contrary though, the Buddhist philosophy and teaching is pervasive  throughout. Yet there is never a lack of respect for other spiritual paths.  A path is set before us with definitions for Ethics of: Restraint, Virtue,  Compassion, and Suffering. We are given a clear understanding of the role  ethics plays in society. World religions are taken to task for providing  yet another reason for propagating hate and/or separating ourselves from  others. We are also left with an appeal for - "Love for others and  respect for their rights and dignity, no matter who or what they are:  ultimately these are all we need."      ',nonspam

Prior to reading this book, I chalked up the misfortunes of the well run companies of our time to the vagaries of the market place and put them in the same shoulder shrugging category of "bad things happen to good  people."  But now I have a new way of looking at success and failure  due to disruptive technology.    I better understand my own frustrations of  trying to do new things in a large corporation given the further insight  from Christensen that assets are really managed by customers, not our own  managers.  That is what makes this book scary.    There seems little hope  of any large corporation staying on top of disruptive technology unless  they follow the prescription of segregating those innovations from the  usual corporate overhead structure. That means spinning off groups, taking  equity positions in start-up firms, and/or completely funding start-ups to  grow the new markets.    The writing is clear, the data gathered is  thorough and fully documented with ample notes, the logic is concise, and  the conclusions are entirely logical. Christensen gives us formulas for  success including agnostic marketing to help us recognize emerging markets.  The case studies are at once interesting and compelling. This is a must  read for managers in any industry. Dr. Andrew S. Grove, Chairman and CEO of  Intel Corporation had this to say, "This book addresses a tough  problem that most successful companies will face eventually. Its lucid,  analytical-and scary."

Kathleen takes the thoughtful reader through a wonderful exercise of reclaiming what for her was a lost vocabulary of faith. Much of what she  had to say about the Christian words I grew up with has been echoed in my  own life, and while I have not gone back to my roots, I do feel much more  comfortable with the old language after having read her book. Bringing  the words of faith to life in our everyday living is certainly a struggle  for most of us. Kathleen shows us some of the ways her own struggles lead  her to at least temporary states of grace. This interesting and useful  approach to defining her own theology was lively, engaging, and compelling  in the sense that she faces her many shortcomings, celebrates her  successes, and continually strives for meaning in her life. Personally, I  find todays organized religion lacking any real meaning. But Kathleen has  shown me how I can at least reclaim some of the vocabulary of faith that I  had long ago thrown out with the other religious baggage of my early years.   Thank you Kathleen.

A Walk Through Time (AWTT) is an incredibly well done book, from all aspects. The artwork and printing make it suitable for display and the  content challenges us to re-think our position in the world and the  decisions we are making. The explanation of evolution is both plausible  and understandable to the lay person. Yet the mystery of life is not  diminished or hidden, so there is more than enough room for those who  understand our existence through their love of God.  Beginning more than  5,000 MYA (5,000 Million Years Ago, or 5 Billion Years Ago) we are told,  the "universe did indeed begin in an explosion of energy powerful  enough to send all matter flying apart for billions of years into the  future." From that starting point, AWTT traces with considerable  detail the evolution of our living earth of which we are a part. And  everywhere the mystery of "the life force" is to be found.  One  can read the prose or follow the exhibition text along the bottom of the  pages, or take in both to re-enforce what is being explained. Sidney Liebes  managed to convince HP of the merits of creating a 1mile "walk through  time." That project is staffed by volunteers and has been presented in  a dozen venues in three countries. The "exhibition text"  mentioned above is from that project.  The final paragraph of the book  summarizes the challenge for our existence in this totally interconnected  web of life. "Is it possible that a sense of awe, wonder and humility,  of origins, place, possibilities, and recovery of a belief in the  sacredness of nature, can, and perhaps must, become operational imperatives  in guiding humanity into the future? Rather than pondering the illusive  purpose of life, can we not accept and appreciate the gift, live the life  we are given, respect all life, and preserve options for the future. Though  none of us has the power to control the future, each of us is free to  determine how we will contribute to the circumstance out of which the  future will evolve." Perhaps the purpose of life is simply to ensure  that life continues. Then there is much in this book to set us on the right  path.      ',nonspam

I was there at the invitation of my daughter to participate in a discussion on relationships. In particular,  our father daughter relationship was to be the topic. So I did get to spend  a few minutes with Scotty and watch his interaction with the students and  faculty members at the table. He is as compassionate, sincere, and full of  fun as his book leads us to believe he is. 	Finding Your Religion is an  invaluable resource and a must read for those folks wanting to put more  life into his or her spiritual practice as well as for those wanting to  branch out and search for a new spiritual path.  This well written, easy to  read manual on why its okay to question our childhood religion does not  let us off the accountability hook. We are still challenged to live our  chosen religion, whatever it may be. There are no simple platitudes or easy  ways out for us. Scotty reminds us over and over to live our religion  everyday and to be the best we can be, whether that is Jewish, Christian,  Bahai, Buddhist, Islamic, Hindu, or Unitarian Universalist. 	By  relating his own story as well as real stories about real people that he  has met in his travels, Scotty brings the struggles along our spiritual  paths to life. We know we arent alone in our searching, and we come to  understand that its the journey that counts. We also learn that there are  many different spiritual paths we can take, but they all have the same goal  - a fuller, richer life for the practitioner.  	The respect Scotty  demonstrates for each individual and each religious path is an attribute  all too rare in our world today. There is more than toleration shown here.  Scotty shows us the way to truly loving our fellow travelers, regardless of  the path they or we choose to get to the top of our spiritual mountain.  After reading this book, one should be much more comfortable with being on  a personal spiritual quest. But it is also a call to action. Finding Your  Religion is a call to really get out there and just do it!      ',nonspam

Khalsa is blunt and too the point. For example: "There is no guessing." He makes it very clear that we must drill down with our questions to find out exactly what the client/customer needs by way of solutions.  By using the acronym "ORDER," which stands for Opportunity, Resources, Decision Process, Exact Solution, and Relationship, Khalsa takes us through the logical development of a truly consultative selling process. The relationship with the customer becomes the engine that makes this process go - seeking to understand before trying to be understood. "If they say it its gold. If you say it, its sold." And nobody likes to be sold.  Khalsa also uses the metaphor of green, yellow, and red lights to explain how to know when to stop and question more deeply. His point is to find out early in the game if the prospect is real - otherwise, dont play. Khalsa goes over some of the usual techniques for obtaining information (Match and lead, feeling questions, etc.), but does so in a very conversational style.  I decided to also listen to the audio tapes of this book. The author read the excerpted book and it was very interesting to hear how he emphasized different points. I found it very instructive to hear Khalsas take on his own work and to hear the authors voice. It wound up actually clarifying some of the portions of the book which I at first found to be a bit different from my own sales training. All in all, this will be a welcomed addition to my library.      ',nonspam
' A103U0Q3IKSXHE	1579549543	May 2, 2005	11	13	4.0	The secret new Methuselah . . .	 Kurzweil is one of my favorite authors. I enjoyed his book on the future of evolution titled The Age of Spiritual Machines, and I highly recommend that book to you as well. This book is a must read for all who are interested in personal health. Even if you do not believe it is possible or desirable to live a VERY long life, you will likely agree that as you do age, you would prefer to be healthy right up to the end. If you do agree, then this book about the science behind radical life extension will be of interest to you. I hope you take the opportunity to get a copy of Fantastic Voyage to learn how to control through life style and eating habits all those things that concern us from heart disease and cancer to Alzheimers disease.  My criticism of the book is only that the authors are a bit "over the top" on what they are doing to extend their own health, and it is very expensive. Not everyone will be able to afford DNA analysis, weekly injections of supplements and 250 pills per day. Other actions that Ray takes are to drink six to eight cups of green tea per day and even more water on top of that. He walks every day and limits what he eats. All of this adds up to a self disciplined routine that the average person will not undertake to accomplish. Still, we can take from this what we can reasonably do while at the same time understanding that we could always do more to make our lives healthier and therefore happier.   The book is written in a clear and conversational tone. The science is explained in terms that I, as a lay person, can understand. And the authors seem honest about the efficacy of the supplements they are recommending - meaning that they state whether or not "clinical testing" has been done or whether the information is more anecdotal.  All in all, this is an excellent reference for those interested in enjoying a healthier life style and to improve their health as they approach senior years.       ',nonspam
' A103U0Q3IKSXHE	0345384563	March 25, 2005	11	11	4.0	Intolerance of monotheism	 I was not disappointed in this volume by Karen Armstrong, one of my favorite authors. It was interesting going back to an earlier book after reading her latest works. While this book is long and a bit tedious for a non-history buff such as I, it was definitely worth the effort.  This is truly a challenging read. Armstrong covers a huge amount of history (about 4,000 years) with densely packed words over approximately 400 pages. The perspective is balanced with insights from many of the world religions and how they may have influenced each other or developed independently. While many of the world religions are mentioned, the focus is on "people of the book;" Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Armstrong points out that "Today we have become so familiar with the intolerance that has unfortunately been a characteristic of monotheism that we may not appreciate that this hostility toward other gods was a new religious attitude."  Armstrong discusses the similarity of developing thought throughout the Muslim world as well as the Christian world and how they tracked through history. She declares that "Christian fundamentalists seem to have little regard for the loving compassion of Christ," and points out that "Muslim fundamentalists have toppled governments and either assassinated or threatened the enemies of Islam with the death penalty. Similarly, Jewish fundamentalists have settled in the Occupied Territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip with the avowed intention of driving out the Arab inhabitants, using force if necessary." She sees this type of religiosity as a retreat from God.  All in all, after a careful and thoughtful reading of this excellent history of the all too human effort to define god, a person will find themselves understanding the sad state of affairs we see today in human spirituality. Its not a pretty picture, but one definitely worth contemplating.      ',nonspam
' A103U0Q3IKSXHE	0684846659	March 18, 2005	2	2	3.0	Break the Habit	 According to Keven Rollins, "Getting results in large companies is a very rare skill and this book captures how to do it. The guidance provided here will prove invaluable for leaders who are trying to drive tighter execution in their organizations."  My reading confirms Rollins statement despite the fact that in the back of my mind I kept thinking about the marketing reasons for Covey writing this book. Still, the information within is useful and builds on the seven habits of highly effective people.  The DVD provided with the book would, I believe, make things easier for folks who learn better visually rather than reading text. While this was a nice touch, it didnt add too much to my understanding of what Covey was trying to convey; but great marketing. The book would have been even more effective if it was half as long. Covey spends too much time rehashing the old habits information.  Covey in his usual conversational style, encourages the reader to "Find your voice and help others find their voice." In some ways, this seems a labored metaphor. Others have said this more succinctly with "Follow your Bliss," or "Discover your Passion." Covey takes great pains to bend his "lessons" into the "find your voice" analogy, and often times the story seems disconnected from the message.  Yet for those who found much meaning in the Seven Habits, this book will add to the rich imagery that Covey created in his earlier book. There are new ways of looking at how we are in relationship with each other and with ourselves. All in all, a book worth reading, though as I said, it could have been quite a bit shorter.

Our paths have continuously crossed since then. I received an early copy of his new book with a request to review it and give feedback. I was only too happy to do so since I knew that Tom had intended to use some of my material on ethics as a business process.  Troiani has organized this book in a logical sequence which allows the reader to build on the foundations set by earlier chapters. The information flows from Governance to Goals, then Cultural Alignment, followed by Communications and Controls. Finally we get to Reality - which ties together all the previous work into a vision for practical success.  Troiani uses stories from practical experience to illustrate how the point being made "looks and feels" in the real world. The practical experience comes from his years as a Business Consultant and Project Manager. This is definitely a book meant to be on your "working reference shelf." While it is straight forward in style and relatively easy to read, it is non-the-less chock full of useful, practical information that you can put to work immediately to make your vision a reality.

Well, if she indeed does practice whats in this volume, she will have a great company soon.  Beckwiths book is easy to read, full of great ideas and has excellent examples from successful and not so successful companies that we all know. He explains why every thing we do is really a service. Even if we have a product to sell. And we come to see why every service needs to be improved if we are to build great companies. He explores how unusual names get you noticed and remembered. And more importantly for us today, he explains why the market is inexorably moving to the rise of invisibles and intangibles (services not material products).  There are a great number of suggestions that will stick with the alert ready. Suggestions such as; "Edit your message until everyone understands it," or "Cut all the fat. Then ask: Does the muscle that remains have power?" All in all, this has been a very useful and instructive read. While not everything was new, there certainly was a new view of the challenges facing our businesses today.      ',nonspam

So I didnt hold out much hope of learning a lot that was new when I picked up this volume. However, I was pleasantly surprised by a couple of things. First, there is a password assigned to each book. With that password you are able to access a web site, establish an account, and answer a questionnaire which does in fact give you your top five strengths.  But what is most useful is that armed with the survey results and this book, you are not only able to know your strengths but also how to build on those strengths. What is new here, is that the authors break the mold of "work on eliminating your weaknesses." Instead, the advise us to pay attention to building up our strengths, to always find ways to use those strengths instead of worrying so much about our weaknesses. Sure, we do have to try and mitigate any negative attributes we may have in order to work with others, but the really successful person will work to play to his or her own strengths.  You will learn why strength is defined as "consistent near perfect performance in an activity." You will see why it makes sense to "manage around your weaknesses." And you will be given clear, concise  guidelines on how to manage others through their strengths and help them manage around their weaknesses. I will definitely be using many of the principles and ideas put forth in this book as I go about helping my clients shape their corporate cultures and improve their effectiveness.      ',nonspam

Boards of all shapes and sizes are wondering about the affect that Sarbanes-Oxley act will have upon their operations, accountability, and liability. But what about the managers running the day-to-day operations? Mr. Green kept his promise to "introduce groundbreaking and practical Control Smart approach that not only meets the requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley, but also alerts you if operational controls stop working or are otherwise compromised."  While larger companies can afford to spend millions of dollars to implement control system monitoring tools, managers of small to mid-sized companies can be unsure of how to move forward if their budgets cant accommodate expensive advisors and systems. Mr. Green tells us in a forthright and clear manner that we must not depend on others to audit accountability into our reporting systems any more than we are able to test reliability or quality into our products. He places responsibility for our transparent transactions squarely on the shoulders of every manager and every employee throughout the organization.  The "Control Smart" approach to understanding where we need to make transformational changes and where we can live with transitional changes is easy to understand even as it is complex and difficult to execute. But we must all attempt to do so. Green insists that we can "walk our talk by taking the culture of our companies seriously. We are able to create positive values as company objectives and appropriately compensate those who uphold the company image." In this well written book, you will find the answer to just what it is that managers today need to do to implement the spirit and the law of Sarbanes-Oxley.      ',spam

Her best selling books, A History of God and Buddha received excellent reviews. Having read Buddha, I was looking forward to Muhammad, and I was not at all disappointed. Somehow, I missed reading A History of God, so I will attend to that next.  "Muhammad had great spiritual as well as political gifts - the two do not always go together - and he was convinced that all religious people have a responsibility to create a good and just society." With this statement, early on in her book, Armstrong sets the tone for an objective look at the third of the Abrahamic religions. With clear logic and supportive historic facts as well as contextual interpretations, she lays before the reader the opportunity to understand the struggles of the Islamic faith.  Armstrong takes us through the development of Muhammad from his early days as the enemy of the establishment in Mecca, to his firm conversion to a man of al-Llah, through wars and political intrigue to, finally, the death of the Prophet. Throughout her journey through Muhammads history, Armstrong enlightens us and helps us sort out fact from fallacy.  The picture of Islam that emerges is one that belies all the turmoil and hand wringing over the concerns of terrorists who continue to use religion to obtain their political ends. Instead, Muslim rulers agree to be held accountable for their actions, and ask their followers to "put them right" if they do not do well by their people. I encourage all who wish to understand the complex issues behind the turmoil and violence of todays world to put this excellent book on their reading list.      ',nonspam
' A103U0Q3IKSXHE	1578517761	September 4, 2004	3	3	5.0	A sane approach to Shaping the Corporate Culture	 Carter and Lorsch have noted that "around the world, scandals and company failures have provoked a storm of criticism and well-meaning reforms. In response, a variety of best practices have emerged, but can such ad hoc adjustments fundamentally change the capacity of boards to provide good governance?"  I attended a Forum for Corporate Directors meeting featuring Professor Lorsch from Harvard Business School - it was an outstanding morning filled with additional insights, confirmations, and new ideas concerning corporate governance. This excellent book extended that rewarding experience and will likely be a constant reference in my corporate governance work. Carter and Lorsch have extensive research (included in appendices) behind their suggestions for change in corporate boards. In a refreshingly clear writing style, they expose the gap between theoretical board design and the practical results of board design. Further, they acknowledge that these gaps cannot be closed completely, nor can they be legislated out of existence. Instead, as always, we must rely on the women and men who sit on boards to have a deep understanding of their mission, the boards mission, a commitment to integrity, and knowledge of the workings of their executive suite.  Back to the Drawing Board is laid out in a logical manner, and approaches this complex issue of properly designing boards in an equally logical manner. The face, head on, the issue of increased time and energy that will be required of new board members. The clearly address the issue of independent directors and squarely address the advantages and disadvantages of independent directors versus executive directors. They also address the concerns of the executive director who, in many respects is required to sit in judgment of her boss. Perhaps most refreshing is the concern that we not throw the baby out with the bath water, that we not think that Sarbanes-Oxley is the complete answer, and that we not expect a "one size fits all" board structure. Rather, we must do the hard work of defining a particular boards role, redesign accordingly, and rethink the processes, practices and policies of our decision makers.  This book is a must read for anyone involved in corporate governance whether they are on a board, aspire to be on a board, consult to those responsible for corporate governance or are a member of the "c" suite.

I knew I was in for a treat when, as is my custom, I flipped through this book before settling down to read it in earnest, and came across the statement that, "Its all a conversation," and if you randomly walked into most companies and ask the employees, Whats the companys vision? the most common answer will be to make money. And if you ask them, To make money for whom? the answer will likely be for the owners, of course. " I wasnt mistaken. Hunter pulled it all together by first describing the existing model, explaining why it doesnt work, then giving us a new model to consider.  In this small volume you will learn about the different listening styles which perpetuate the existing dysfunctional model we all tend to use. You will see how that model is surely not suited for our post-modern world. You will find a new model based on real relationship building. But perhaps the most refreshing thing for me was Hunters unabashed statement that one is the source of what one sees. That is to say, there is no one truth, but rather only our perceptions. Hunter says it this way, "No, its not the truth; its only your truth! We dont describe the world we see-we see the world we describe!"  Hunters work is compelling, easily read, and straight to the point with real life examples and case studies. I might have found it a bit easier to follow if he had provided some hints on where to find some of the material that he referred back to from time-to-time. I didnt always remember the details when he referred me to a previous case, and it would have been helpful to have a hint, such as what chapter to go back to in order to refresh the details. But that is a small complaint considering all the good I got from reading the book. All in all, a fine piece of work and well worth your time to read. And follow through with the exercise at the end of chapter two, you will be surprised I bet.      ',nonspam

Direct Marketing at Yahoo!, tells us how to turn strangers into friends and friends into customer in the excellent book on how to be successful in marketing your products and services. I can only hope that every SPAM marketer, direct mail marketer and fax-blast marketer reads this book. Perhaps if they do, we will all have a lot fewer useless intrusions in our lives.  The bottom line of this very well written and entertaining book is that Godin advises us that "The goal is to avoid surprising the consumers and interacting with them by sending only messages they expect." Those of us who were trained in consultative selling techniques will recognize much of what Godin advocates, but he packages even these "old ideas" in such a way as they are now usable in the new world of internet communications and e-commerce.  Godin gives us the logic behind what most of us have intuitively decided is true - TV advertising doesnt work, direct marketing (as done today) is a waste of time and money, we are squandering our internet marketing opportunity, and we are alienating potential long-term relationships. Godin outlines for tests for permission marketing which, by definition, offers consumers incentives to accept advertising voluntarily.

' A103U0Q3IKSXHE	1400042216	July 18, 2004	8	11	4.0	Political decision makers required reading . . .	 Why Liberals will win the battle for America is the subtitle for Mr. Reichs latest book. A month or so ago, I was privileged to hear him discuss this book and his findings at a very large gathering. The response to his presentation was one of support and encouragement. Yet, while certainly liberals come to hear Mr. Reich, I happen to know that there were many "conservatives" in the audience and they too were applauding. Why is that? What is the appeal to conservatives? I would like to think that the appeal is simply one of, well, REASON! It may also be that the old labels no longer apply to the average American. It may well be that Republicans, Democrats, Green Party, Libertarians, and those who decline to disclose any party affiliation all have come to understand that things are too complex for sound bites and that reason must prevail. They may be finally getting the message that we are all in the same boat together and so we must work together with respect and compassion. For those who embrace reason, compassion, and a sense of connectedness, this book will provide much with which to agree, and will provide provocative ideas with which we might reasonably disagree and debate. Reich certainly doesnt shy away from taking a position, regardless of whos toes he might crunch. For those who believe that globalization is killing jobs he has this message: "Every task thats repetitive-anything that can be done more cheaply by automated machinery or computer software or by a person laboring in a poor country-is no longer going to be done by Americans at American wages. Period." For those who would continue to ignore the growing separation of the haves and the have-nots, he has this message: "In America in the twenty-first century, real prosperity is shared prosperity. Thats what we are losing rapidly, and thats why Radcons are wrong and their thinking is dangerously obsolete." Radcons? Yes, Mr. Reich is not above taking his shot at the Radical Conservatives he believes are creating a situation of further economic stratification and therefore internal strife in America. This book is definitely good reading for all of us, regardless of the label put on us and regardless of whether or not we agree with everything Mr. Reich has to say. The book is truly based on reason. I hope all political decision makers find the time to read "Reason, why Liberals will Win the Battle for America." It should be required reading for us all.

Richard Holloway writes a very compassionate and air-tight case for dragging Christianity kicking and screaming into the modern world. Holloway recently stood down as Bishop of Edinburgh, but he has not forgotten all that he has experienced as one of the most outspoken and best-loved figures in the modern church. I believe this book is another of his many attempts to get religion back on the right track. And, it was a natural to pick this up after reading his last book, Godless Morality. In this book, Holloway successfully argues that Christians must reclaim the spirit of Jesus that: challenges tyrannous absolutes, the angry pity and endless challenge of social hope, and the incredible capacity for forgiveness. These three elements are what remain of a Christianity that is of use to the modern human enterprise. The conclusion Holloway reaches about why he wrote this book is that: "a liberating truth underlies it. I have come to believe passionately that we should treat a belief as a habit of action rather than as an accurate representation of metaphysical reality, to quote Charles Sanders Peirce." This pragmatic approach to Christianity allows for a world view that is lest dogmatic, violent, and judgmental. It is refreshing to say the least.  There are, I think, many of us - Christians or other faiths or even non-believers - who will applaud Holloways conclusion that even though it is a bit late to have discovered it, there is still time to dismantle all the judgmental and hateful words we have built for Christ and simply tried to follow him, preferably in silence. AMEN.      ',spam

The book is a collection of experiences, impressions, and encounters with reality as the authors travel across the American continent looking for the various incarnations of Buddha along the way. The religious community has nothing to fear from the work of Manseau and Sharlet. They do not attack any religion, but rather they celebrate the spiritual venture many of us seem to be working toward. At the same time, they have an incredible collection of stories to keep us open minded about where we might encounter our own Buddha.

' A103U0Q3IKSXHE	0334027314	July 18, 2004	1	1	4.0	Being? Who can say?	 Don Cupitt is a Senior Fellow of Emmanuel College in Cambridge. In this excellent book, he grapples with the relationship between language and non-language, and along the way, he somehow manages to get to a spiritual approach to human existence. Cupitt proposes that we have "created vast protective ideologies of denial, as if we have found the obvious truth of our own situation quite unbearable, and have been willing to buy absolutely anything that promises to deliver us from it." This understanding has caused me to re-think my own situation and how I am protective of "my world view" and how I fit into the scheme of things. By understanding that the language model to which I pay attention shapes that world view, it becomes obvious that "being" cannot be until I shed, or at least live in an experience as much outside that model as possible. Of course, all this reminded me of my Taoist studies and how that Tao which can be named is not the real Tao. And that we create opposites and limit the experience when we name things. There can be no "good" without "evil," etc. These concepts are very difficult to understand, and certainly they are not easily explained in the very language which we are want to leave behind! Perhaps the dilemma set up in the very last of the book is best to explain the difficulty in getting this all in orderly thought: "To the philosophy of the future, and to the religion of the future we offer the formula: non-language is Being. And Being - whats that? Answer: Nobody can say, but this book was meant to be a sort of poem in praise of it." To which I say, great poetry, indeed.      ',nonspam
' A103U0Q3IKSXHE	0944344836	July 18, 2004	4	4	5.0	Geering gets it right, others must.	 Lloyd Geering is one of my favorite theologians and he did not let me down with this "map of modern religious history." Through a carefully documented and well thought out logical progression, this professor emeritus  of religious studies at Victoria University leads the alert and open minded reader to an understanding of where religion stands today and how we have come to this place. He starts by acknowledging that religion is dealing with a changing world. "Because, as human beings, we are at the very centre of modern change, and have the most to gain or lose by the direction it takes, we are in no position simply to ignore it once we have come to recognise [sic] its existence." He then goes on to build a case for the world being in the second threshold of cultural change in response of faith to ultimate issues which we call religion. This second threshold is now encircling the globe. Geerings clear writing style and excellent logical progression soon draws the reader into an understanding that "Much modern atheism, for example, is a protest, in the interests of truth, against false religious beliefs and superstitious practices." The case is solid and the challenge, then, for people of faith, is to develop a world view that is in agreement with all the knowledge that humankind gathers. But the case is not made by appealing to "faith," or by threatening hell and damnation; no, the case is made with clear-eyed logical views of the future grounded in a deep understanding of the history of the religious institutions of the world and a profound understanding of the humans need for a sense of meaning. I recall having the same feeling of optimism, compassion, and prophetic understanding of our human predicament as I sat at dinner with Professor Geering some years ago. His conversation was compelling, logical, and inclusive of those at our table. His book approaches this sensitive subject with the same compassion and love of the religious path as I sensed that evening. Still, his is a tough love and he calls the game as he sees it. He notes that we must accept that we are alone in this venture. Perhaps this is best summed up in his own words: "People must re-learn what it means to live by faith alone. Humans now have to live without the divine and other supernatural props thought to exist in the past. There are no divinely revealed truths. There are no absolute and solid-rock certainties. The throne of heaven is empty. Indeed there is no heaven. This life is all there is. Moreover, with regard to the future of human existence on this planet, humans are now required to play the role they once attributed to an external deity." Indeed. Perhaps if more recognized our situation for what it is, wed be better stewards of the earth and each other.      ',spam

For several years now, Ive been working with Bill on various projects for the Association of Professional Consultants and Ive had the pleasure of reading his bi-monthly Newsletter. So I was familiar with his writing and speaking style, which is why I was so interested in getting to his new book. I wasnt disappointed. This book is written in Bills warm, down-to-earth style, giving the reader the impression that they are spending quality one-on-one time with a senior consultant and coach. Birnbaums unconventional wisdom comes through in this most readable book on Business Strategy. How often do you hear someone say that its "okay to be mediocre?" Well, Bill lets you know that as long as you are excelling at those few important strategic goals, its okay to be mediocre at everything else. Refreshing, isnt it? Honest, straightforward thought. Bill continues in the same vein to give us practical advice on process and procedures. Not only does he share with us what we might consider doing, he goes about explaining how we might do it. Most of us in the consulting business are willing to share what we believe you should do, its when we get to the "how" that we start issuing proposals and contracts! But throughout this book, Bill shares with us the how as well as the what and the why! Besides reinforcing some of the things we know, such as "focus on doing the right things more than on doing things right," we are treated to lively and real life examples and stories exemplifying the strategies Bill lays out. As you would expect, the book is laid out in four sections, one for each of the major puzzle pieces - focus, process, people, markets. There is a very useful index as well, and some of the best information in the book can be found in the Appendix, so dont skip them! He keeps our interest up and he delivers on his promise to - "steepen your growth curve, brighten your profit picture, and help you to lead your management team." I highly recommend you put this book on your must read list!      ',spam

She has captured and made accessible the concept of synergy in a real Mastermind Team, and given us a step by step instruction manual to building our own team. In clear language and forthright thought, Ms. Brecher gives us the 8 steps, the advantages for each step, and the pitfalls that await us if we are unaware. She eloquently makes the case for why we should even consider a Mastermind Team, then goes about helping us to know that we too can form such a team.

Litman and Oman have pulled together transcripts from the Mike Litman show interviews with successful Millionaires. In each interview are buried nuggets of gold that will inspire new ideas and incite action in your life. The best part is, you can read each interview independently and in any order you need. The layout and the "lets get to it" approach matches our sense of urgency. I found this book especially interesting since I recently finished the One Minute Millionaire by Hansen and Allen. In fact, my on-line review of that book is how Mr. Litman found me and suggested that Conversations with Millionaires would be a logical extension of my reading in this area of self-improvement and motivation. Indeed it was for me and will be for you. But even if you have not yet read Hansens book, Conversations will be an excellent introduction to the concepts explored in depth by Hansen and Allen. There are nine successful self-made millionaires who share their secrets with us through the lively interviews with Mr. Litman. The secrets will give you a leg up on the learning curve for how to diversify your income. I know it has helped me put my own multiple streams of income into perspective and validated some of what I had been struggling to organize in my mind. There will undoubtedly be at least one story in this book that will speak to you and light your path to financial independence. Conversations with Millionaires is success in action. It has managed to put into practice the lessons held within and is itself an example of positive thinking, tithing, and wisdom all rolled into one highly accessible book.

There are many memorable points of view, but perhaps the one that sticks most in my mind is that quiet leaders possess three very unglamorous virtues: restraint, modesty, and tenacity. "Each of these is a habit of mind and action, and each helps men and women use the tools and tactics of quiet leadership in responsible, effective ways." But what is quiet leadership and who are the quiet leaders? Quiet leadership is dealing with the messy, everyday challenges, and the quiet leaders are those who labor endlessly to meet those challenges and keep things moving in our corporations. They are NOT the "flashy, public hero" kinds of leaders. They simply get the work done and make the hard decisions. Badaracco convinces me more than ever that it is imperative that we define our corporate moral values and clearly articulate the ethics process we use to choose between competing moral and/or economic values. The reason is that the hard choices are embedded in our everyday corporate life. In these situations, individuals rarely take bold or courageous steps. Rather they step back, study, analyze, worry, and finally, make the best decision they can make - then stand behind it and move on. Quiet leaders possess a positive attitude, but they are also very realistic, not cynical, in evaluating the situation. These leaders work with four basic principles: 1-You dont know everything; 2-You WILL be surprised; 3-Keep and eye on the insiders, and 4-Trust, but cut the cards! They learn to trust mixed motives rather than trying to define their actions in purist terms. In other words, they accept that the right solution can also include positive results for themselves as well as the company, employee, and/or customer. This well written and well organized book is definitely worth the time and should be in any management library.      ',nonspam

Thomas is about how Era, Values, and Defining Moments Shape Leaders. And it does an excellent job of pointing out the differences between our generations. This Harvard Business School Press publication is definitely useful in understanding the way folks in my parents generation (the Geezers) react to those in my childrens generation (Geek) . Based on their definitions for Geeks and Geezers, I am in between the two, yet most of my acquaintances put me in the Geek category due to my love of and work in the world of technology. The basic premise of this book is that all leaders must go through a "crucible" of some kind. The kind of leadership characteristics we have may be different because of our environments (Geezers defined by WWII, Parental fallibility, etc. and Geeks by abundance, opportunity, technology and globalization), but every leader is tested somehow. The different environments and experiences affects the needs, wants, character and maturation process for these people and therefore define the differences in leadership style. After exploring historical experiences and interviewing both groups, the authors complete their leadership model with Era and Individual factors feeding into the crucible of Experiences. The crucible heats up experiences and organization of meaning that develops Leadership competencies. The crucible might be military service in the case of the Geezer of business failure in the case of the Geeks, but whatever that life changing crucible is, it is the one thing that is common to leadership. This book is worth your time and consideration if for no other reason than to understand the value of the crucible we may now be going through in our contracting economy - this so called job-loss recovery.

It has turned out to be an excellent recommendation. Two great books in one - the left side of each page has a story for my left brain and the right side has a story for my right brain. This volume is full of ideas on how to develop multiple streams of income and leverage talents of those around you. From the Millionaire Ahas the authors take us through Mentors, Teams, Networks, and the manifestations of all that weve learned. This is accomplished with both the "text book" approach (left side pages) while weaving a wonderful story that exemplifies the lessons in prose (right side pages). I was so impressed with this book that I rented the audio version so that I could re-enforce the lessons while driving around town. Many say that today we are not just in a "jobless recovery," but that we are in a "job-LOSS recovery." Those in my network would agree, and they would also agree that this book shows the only way out of the dilemma for many people in transition. Whether you learn the lesson from the heart-rending story of Michelle Ericksen or from the more traditional approach, the One Minute Millionaire is more than worth your time, it is worth your effort to employ the lessons.

' A103U0Q3IKSXHE	0066620996	September 1, 2003	5	10	5.0	Taking us to the next level	 This book has come highly recommended by several of my colleagues. I thoroughly enjoyed Built to Last, so I was looking forward to this book as well, and I was not disappointed. Mr. Collins has another winner on his hands. A key message in this excellent management treatise is that true leaders build organizations that will last long after they are gone. They put excellent people together first and then figure out what the company will do. If the company already exists, they put the right people in the right jobs and then make sure that the company is headed in the right direction. This is right in keeping with what I have been suggesting to those attending my Ethics as a Business Process seminars. We need to make sure we are building human resources and processes for the long term and not be focused on the short term (quarterly) results. Focus on those short term results forces managers to make incorrect decisions for the STAKEHOLDERS.  Another key point is that we need to account for the stakeholders not just the stockholders. When we are concerned about all those in our business chain, we do not make decisions that make only one group happy at the expense of others. So customers, employees, stockholders, and those in proximity to our physical plants and services must be taken into account as well. Collins presents the "Hedgehog Concept" and the three circles as a model to make his points. One circle is "What you are deeply passionate about." A second circle is "What drives your economic engine." The third circle is "What you can be the best in the world at." The intersection of the three circles is where we need to spend our time and energy. The Great Companies are more like hedgehogs--they know one big but simple thing and they stick to it, at all costs. They arent the flashy technology companies, they are the tried and true long term companies that keep producing sustained great results. Collins also presents the concept of the Level 5 leader. Level 1 are highly capable individuals, level 2 are contributing team members, level 3 are competent managers, level 4 are effective leaders. And then there is the level 5 executive or leader who builds enduring greatness through a paradoxical blend of personal humility and professional will. Level 5 leadership is not just about humility and modesty; it is equally about ferocious resolve, and almost stoic determination to do whatever needs to be done to make the company great. Level 5 leaders are fanatically driven, infected with an incurable need to produce results, and they work at the intersection of the three circles. The book is documented with the Collins trademark studies, surveys, and interviews. He gives us a periodic view of how his research team argued over and hashed out the details which resulted in this excellent book. And the surprise? The surprise is that this is not a follow on to Built to Last but rather it is best positioned as a prequel to that book. If you havent read Built to Last, read Good to Great first and then read Built to Last. Both are excellent and by reading them in the suggested order, the puzzle pieces will simply fall together. Definitely a five out of five on my scale.      ',nonspam

This could have been a five star book, but Ray Strand insisted on peppering us with language of a particular religious world view that has made it difficult to believe in the rest of his recommendations. Personally, I wanted to read the book for solid scientific information on nutrition, I could have done without the narrow religious statements. However, if you can get by the self-serving public piousness, there is good information on nutrition, diet, supplements and exercise which will serve us all well. For years I fought the use of supplements as being a waste of money. I subscribed to the view that if you ate a reasonable diet of vegetables and fruit, you would get all the nutrients you need. Perhaps that was true at one time, but with the high levels of pollution in our environment, poor animal husbandry, and depleted farm lands, we have to resort to the use of supplements. I am now convinced that high quality dietary supplements are a requirement for a healthy life. If you cant find any other books on nutrition, then this one might serve to get you started.

As a humanist, this topic is always of interest to me, and I found Barbours view on process theology most interesting. The typology of the book was such that four "topics" were discussed in each chapter with respect to the "view" being discussed: Conflict, Independence, Dialogue, and Integration. So, for instance Astronomy and Creation are "analyzed" from those four points, as are the other major sticking points between science and religion. Barbour seems to treat each position with respect and objectivity and clearly states his own position so that the reader is not required to "guess" where he is coming from in his own thinking. For example, in chapter five (Genet6ics, Neuroscience, and Human Nature) Barbour states clearly the "I will defend an integral view of the person as a psychosomatic unity, which I believe is closer to both the biblical view and the evidence from contemporary science." And so it goes through all the major topics of the book. And, in the next to the last paragraph, we have this conclusion: "Finally, I find the concepts of process philosophy particularly helpful, but I am aware that a single coherent set of philosophical categories may not do justice to the rich diversity of human experience." In the end, Barbour has not convinced me to leave off my Humanist views, but he has indeed given me the framework I need to understand the need for others to use a religious model to express their sense of unity with all the Cosmos. As he so eloquently explains, all models are limited and partial, and none gives a complete or adequate picture of reality. So it is just a matter of where you wish to put your faith when it comes to understanding your own place in that infinity. One can put faith in science eventually giving us answers to the major questions we have or one can put faith in religion explaining the mysteries. Whichever system one chooses, one must keep in mind that no one model fulfills all needs or answers all questions. From the Foreword: "Quantum Physics: A Challenge to Our Assumptions about Reality? Classical physics was deterministic and reductionistic in assuming that the behavior of all objects could be exactly predicted from accurate knowledge of their smallest components. Quantum physics, by contrast, acknowledges an inherent uncertainty in the prediction of events at the atomic and subatomic levels. It is also holistic in showing that the behavior of larger wholes is not simply the sum of the behavior of their parts, but involves distinctive system laws. More over, the quantum world can never be known as it is in itself, but only as it interacts with the observer in a particular experimental system. Quantum physics thus suggests the openness of the future, the inter connectedness of events, and the limitations of human knowledge. Some theistic interpreters propose that God determines the indeterminacies left open by the laws of quantum physics. Advocates of Eastern mysticism say that quantum holism supports their belief in the fundamental unity of all things. The new physics has led scientists, philosophers, and theologians to exciting discussions about time, causality, and the nature of reality."      ',nonspam
' A103U0Q3IKSXHE	0787956988	July 29, 2003	1	13	3.0	A cry into the wind . . .	 The challenge of fusing Christian values with business life. I find it very difficult to deal with individual moral value systems in the business world. So, as a manager, I developed a concept of Ethics is a Business Process in which clearly stated moral values of the company are inculcated throughout the corporation; in mission and vision statements, in slogans, in training, in policies and procedures. These values cannot be based on religion and still be welcoming to our increasingly multi-ethnic workforce here in the U.S. and around the world. Rather, I believe we must keep religion out of the ethical process. Yet we know that individuals most often include their religious up-bringing in the list of "where I get my moral values." Usually listed are family, school, and religious institute. So how do we keep things separate while honoring the basis for our moral sources? Nash and McLennan posit that from a Christian point of view, the coping mechanisms are neither active nor developing synergy between faith and business. The wake-up call they wish to pronounce in this book is limited in that they really only address Christianitys view and interaction. While this is certainly a significant view, it is not a majority view and is becoming more of a minority view in our culture. This, therefore, limits the usefulness of this book to managers in the business world unless they can make the translation from Christianity to "any religious or cultural" group.  I found the book useful in outlining the difficulties faced by business people today. But I did not find hope for an easy or even difficult solution. Instead, I became more convinced than ever that we need to make religion a personal and PRIVATE affair and make sure that our business moral values are clearly stated in secular terms so that we as employees or service providers can decide on the appropriate interaction with the corporation. Today, science informs our moral values more eloquently than many religious institutions and therefore informed individuals turn to those sources whenever possible. As a business executive, I remain unconvinced that we can bring religious language into the multi-cultural workplace without creating severe strain and discomfort for the employees. If there is a homogeneous workforce of one culture and/or one religious faith, then there is no difficulty. Luckily, that is rarely the case. I find the multi-cultural environment to be most stimulating and intellectually preferable to a homogeneous workplace. So I vote for clearly defined secular moral values in the workplace. Keep religion out.      ',nonspam

I admit to struggling with this excellent book for much of the first half, then, after digesting as much as I could, the last half was a bit easier. Dennett does his usual outstanding job of defining and carefully leading us through the many different arguments around his controversial topic of Free Will. Having read both Consciousness Explained and Darwins Dangerous Ideas, I was really looking forward to this book as well. Little did I know that it would so challenge my focus and ingrained ideas about determinism and free will. Dennett shows that determinism does not imply inevitability. As if that isnt enough to struggle with, he then goes on to show that indeterminism doesnt give us free will as most people argue it does. And then, to add insult to injury, Dennett shows clearly how there are real options in a deterministic world. Free will becomes "real, but it is not a preexisting feature of our existence, like the law of gravity. It is also not what tradition declares it to be: a God-like power to exempt oneself from the causal fabric of the physical world. It is an evolved creation of human activity and beliefs, and it is just as real as such other human creations as music and money. And even more valuable." Since I speak and lecture on Ethics as a Process, I was most interested in Dennetts view on ethics. He gave me much to think about as he states that: "I have not sought to replace the voluminous work in ethics with some Darwinian alternative, but rather to place that work on the foundation it deserves: a realistic, naturalistic, potentially unified vision of our place in nature."  No doubt I will have to return to this book again soon. And there is also no doubt that I will enjoy it even more the next time around and learn perhaps as much as my first time through. This is definitely a five out of five on my review scale!      ',spam

Of her years as a consultant, Ms. Toffler says, "one important thing Ive learned is that most people do not want to do unethical things. Usually, unethical or illegal behavior happens when decent people are put under unbearable pressure to do their jobs and meet ambitious goals without the resources to get the job done right." Her conclusion from her years at AA is that its not the bad apples that cause the problems, its the rotten culture. When an organizations leadership team takes their eye off the reason for the organizations existence (to provide a useful service or product to the consumer), and begins focusing on profit to the near exclusion of other values, then the inevitable slide to extinction begins.   One cannot help but to wonder how we can possibly effectively change our corporations to provide the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people when some of those stakeholders (investors in particular) insist on short term gains versus building enduring organizations. Finally, Ms. Toffler offers hope - lots of hard work, but some hope. Starting with what she knows best (corporations) she advises that we: (1) accept the appropriate level of regulation on our public accountants and client organizations (Sarbanes-Oxley as an example is a good start, but needs to go further); (2) change executive compensation to better balance the short term goals with building an organization to last; (3) rethink the structure of the CPA firms - partnerships dont work here; (4) know the true client - who really is the end user and are you serving their best interest; (5) limit the perks and goodies between customers, clients, and your own organization; (6) stay out of the campaign financing game - influence peddling can only hurt a large number of people.   This book should be on every leaders desk and the lessons learned should be truly embraced, inculcated throughout our organizations, and expanded to our larger world economic community. A five out of five rating for Ms. Toffler.      ',nonspam

Of all the books Ive read on change management this is the most precise in its statement about how corporations need to manage the continuous innovation of their business model in order to survive and thrive in our global, competitive marketplace. Replete with real world examples of successful business model innovation, traps, and pitfalls, this clearly written book provides definitions, case studies, and "rules to live by." Continually provide more benefits for your customers; ". . . business model obsolescence is the major unperceived opportunity for and threat to all businesses now" is the self-proclaimed "Big Idea" of this book. Indeed it is. From that theme, Mitchell and Coles go on to build an air-tight case for continuous business model improvement. And the business model is simply defined as the: Who, What, When, Where, Why, How, and How Much for your product or service. But the simplicity of this concept of a business model should not mislead the reader. There is a significant amount of introspection and work that a leadership team must go through to really understand the answers to these questions in order to map where they are today and what they might do to positively change the model. Mitchell and Coles keep our interest through real live case studies as well as tracking the growth of a childs Lemonade Stand business. The book is divided into four major parts: 1 The Most Productive Areas for Business Model Innovation; 2. Provide Sustained Benefits for All Stakeholders; 3. Expand Business Model Innovation; and 4. Pursue Higher-Potential Business Model Improvement. Each of these sections use real life case studies and hypothetical Lemonade Stands to illustrate the business change management principles. Those examples also provide hope and encouragement to leadership teams in all kinds of businesses that they are not alone in keeping change management from becoming an oxymoron! After reading this book, you will want to keep it handy for reference, ideas for new paths to explore, and to loan to others who seem simply not to "get it!" What I appreciated most was the honest focus on providing what customers and end users really want in a product or service. Starting there, we can drive our companies to greater achievements by continuous business model innovation. Rarely do I rate a book a five on a scale of five, but Mitchell and Coles get that rating for The Ultimate Competitive Advantage! Dave Kinnear, CEO, dbkAssociates, Inc.      ',spam

Despite the fact that there is a great deal of information in this timely book that will help clarify the trends in globalization, the didactic and often condescending language put me off and made it difficult for me to absorb the good information, experiences, examples, and messages. To make things even worse, I decided to get an audio version of the book to see if I was "misreading" the tone. Bad move! The impression I was receiving from the written word was amplified when I listened to Mr. Friedman read his own material. Still, if you can get by the tone and absorb the message, there is much to commend the book for those of us in the global business market. And, to hear Friedman tell it, economic leaders in the rest of the world had better listen up.      ',nonspam

In this book Kotter explains how people change less because they are given analysis and facts about why change is needed and more because we show them a truth that influences their feelings. This concept is not adopted by all those writing on change management. Yet it is a concept that does fit with my experience. Unless the facts, figures, and general information presented by those wanting to effect change is compelling enough to generate the feelings that change is a requirement, then change will not happen. Kotter puts it this way: See, Feel, Change. So the information and analysis must be geared toward the "seeing," and the "feeling" in order to prompt people to change. If we do not actively pursue the task of driving necessary change, change management becomes an oxymoron - change forced upon us becomes chaos and we do not manage the change, it manages us. One of the things I enjoyed most about reading this book was the clear and logical layout with the interesting web-page navigation graphics. Also the case studies from "real life" gave practical examples of what successful change might look like in our companies. His eight steps to successful change are: 1. Increase Urgency, 2. Build the Guiding Team, 3. Get the Vision Right, 4. Communicate for Buy-In, 5. Empower Action, 6. Create Short-Term wins, 7. Dont let up, 8. Make Change Stick. All of this helps in building a practice of Shaping the Corporate Culture, which is, of course, near and dear to our hearts at dbkAssociates. Many of the insights in this book will be of practical use to us and to our clients.      ',nonspam

I had the pleasure of listening to Dave DeLuca speak about his Hindu religious journey and his love for the teachings of Vivekananda. He is passionate about this topic and so far, this book shows his love and compassion for bringing an open and inclusive spiritual view to the world. His passion for Yogi Vivekananda comes through in his editing effort. The selections that DeLuca chose are indeed inspirational and give a clear image of the Unity of all existence that seems to be the corner stone of life philosophy from India. The story of Swami Vivekananda is compellingly told and rivets the reader. The short clearly written teachings can be read in just about any order, used as daily meditations, and revisited over and over again. Along the way, this uplifting volume will provide insight into the Vedanta philosophy. If you have the opportunity to hear DeLucas presentation, take it. If you have the opportunity to read this book, take it! An excellent addition to anyone open to understanding and embracing the concept of the interconnected web of all existence. Whatever your religious (or non-religious) grounding, you will likely enjoy this book.      ',nonspam

Like many folks, I had a pretty dim view of the overly aggressive sales tactics and misleading meeting agendas that I ran into with many of the earlier direct marketing efforts. Now I see that things have changed for the better - much better! Inventory is not in your home, its not in someone elses garage, it is at the distributor and easily obtained through the internet. Supply chain management is superb in these new companies. For example, King and Robinson provide statistics to show why direct marketing is a robust and very efficient model for introducing some products into the market place. And, they show why the type of person involved in network marketing today is truly a professional: "Of key interest, the research found successful (direct and network marketing) sales people have a communication style or social style that encourages the building of relationships with their customers . . . The most successful sales leaders have a combination of relationship and task orientation (in their communication styles)." Network Marketing and multilevel marketing are synonymous terms. They are defined by a business model which pays commissions on multiple levels of the sales organization. Network Marketing/Selling differs from Direct Selling in that Network Marketing:  1. Focuses on relationships rather than on closing the sale or booking an order   2. Focuses on information sharing   3. Independent business owner (IBO)   4. Commissions on multiple levels of sales (not just retail of the IBO)  The role of the network marketing channel is to accelerate the movement of products using the most efficient distribution technique: word-of-mouth communication. This is an excellent book to bring you up to date on the network marketing phenominon and to understand the new business models (yes, there are many).      ',nonspam

If you havent read this classic on speeding up your organizations product and service life cycle, now may be a good time to do so. Praise for this book, as listed on the back of the dust jacket, come from Ford Motor Company, Quantum Corporation and others with Ed McCraken, CEO of Silicon Graphics Computer Systems stating that this is; "A must read for executive who seek speed and competitiveness." Mr. Meyer utilizes an "ongoing case study" to make his points concerning FCT processes. This approach lends credence to his positions and gives the book a solid feel of practicality. In addition, frequent use of diagrams helps the reader visualize the organizations, processes, information flow, and cross functional activities of organizations. The layout of the book is logical and provides for continuity as Meyer builds on each preceding chapter. The book is filled with excellent observations and pithy sayings: "The responsibility for strategic alignment rests with senior management." "Any organization leader who seeks to empower people should first create a clear strategic context that enables others to use the power with which they were born." "Research demonstrates there is a negative correlation between economic growth rate and the number of Nobel prizes won." "A sustainable FCT capability can be achieved only by learning faster, not by working faster."      ',nonspam

This book, Execution, by Larry Bossidy and Ram Charan is recommended by my CEO Roundtable, so were in to it now! According to the dust jacket: "Larry Bossidy is one of the worlds most acclaimed CEOs, a man with few peers who has a track record for delivering results. Ram Charan is a legendary advisor to senior executives and boards of directors, a man with unparalleled insight into why some companies are successful and others are not. Together, theyve pooled their knowledge and experience into the one book on how to close the gap between results promised and results delivered that people in business need today."  We will undoubtedly pull this book apart by the paragraph and page in the CEO Roundtable, but I couldnt wait to finish it between meetings. Bossidy and Charan give us great insight into how we can transform our business culture to be one of continual execution. Practical examples and case studies are provided, along with pithy sayings that will help us get the point across to our peers, managers, and employees. Bossidy states that: "Here is the fundamental problem: people think of execution as the tactical side of the business, something leaders delegate while they focus on the perceived bigger issues. This idea is completely wrong. Execution is not just tactics-it is a discipline and a system." The layout of the book, and its progress is logical and very helpful. The first part is dedicated to why execution is needed, the second to the building blocks of execution and the third part is dedicated to the three core processes of execution. This last and perhaps most practical section of the book defines the three core processes as people, strategy and operations. The integration of these processes into a coherent set of business processes is key to the success of an organization. "The discipline of execution based on the three core processes is the new theory of leadership and organization distilled from practice and abbreviation." Clear and concise writing, a few well placed graphics, and an obvious passion for the subject make this an excellent book for the Management Library. It will be among my reference volumes for some time to come.      ',nonspam

This book was first mentioned to me at a Leadership presentation at one of the not-for profit organizations I serve, and then again a short while later at a UCI Graduate School of Management presentation by a local executive. This is a delightful small book filled with some good advice, pithy sayings and leadership insights. Hesselbein lives up to her reputation in this compendium of essays on Leadership. I rather like books of essays because often each chapter, or essay, stands on its own and can be read or re-read as the need arises.  Hesselbein writes in a clear and conversational manner that makes it easy to understand her point. But one should not be lulled into complacency while enjoying her most readable style for the insights to be shared are important and many. She points out with great understatement that "Leadership is a matter of how to be rather than how to do it." She offers as whole new way of organizing our enterprises as she explains "Managing in a World That Is Round." This book will find its best use for those managers looking for a metaphor or simple explanation to share with others in the organization such complex topics as organizational change, behavior, and interaction with the environment. It will be on my reference shelf for a long time to come.      ',nonspam
' A103U0Q3IKSXHE	0060506539	November 16, 2002	33	34	5.0	The seeds of hope within . . .	 I received this book in proof edition from one of my Religion Editor friends. She has done me a great service. I found the thought process and information provided by Kimball to be most compelling. The book is well laid out and well written with concise expression of ideas. I have long believed that religion as we know it today has become corrupted by men (and I do mean men since the religions are mostly controlled by men, not women). But Kimball puts into eloquent words those ideas and concepts which I found I could only hold in my mind and not express. Like so many books in this genre, When Religion Becomes Evil was scheduled for publication on the one year anniversary of the 9/11/01 tragedies. It could not have been timed better or be more relevant and important. For it not only points out the five basic corruptions that manifest themselves in each of the major religious traditions, but it holds out hope that each of those religions has within it the wherewithal to root out and correct those flaws. Yet we must be willing to hold ourselves and our faith institutions accountable for the intolerance we practice. Kimball states that religion is arguably the most powerful and persuasive force on earth and that yes, it is the problem. It is the problem because each seems to hold that it alone has the absolute truth, demands blind obedience, and justifies the means used by the end goal (presumably salvation or "right living.") Somehow, Kimball has reinvigorated the often used argument that the basic teaching of the world faith traditions (Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Hindu and Buddhist) have been used for corrupt ends, yet are in themselves the seeds for healing. "The complicity of religious persuasions in global conflicts today is undeniable, but understanding this complicity requires that we clearly grasp the difference between what we have called corrupt forms of religious commitment and the authentic forms that offer hope." The message of this book, so eloquently and convincingly written, is one that all lay people should embrace. We must hold ourselves and our faith institutions accountable for our actions in the world. For "a segregated group in which the thinking and critical decisions reside with one or a few people, particularly where there is apocalyptic teaching involved, is a disaster waiting to happen."

' A103U0Q3IKSXHE	1573927562	July 29, 2002	1	1	4.0	Proud roots for the humanists . . .	 Another book recommended by my good friend and mentor, Dr. Gus Rath, and another winner. This small volume gives a wonderfully concise synopsis of the history of Western Atheism. It gives some hope to those who want to understand that they are not alone in their humanist or agnostic view of the world. They in fact are part of a long history and associated with some of the most powerful "thinkers" of our species. Comfort can be taken in the acknowledgement that many "theologians and religious philosophers now openly state, that religion is a blik, a perspective, an attitude, a way of looking at the world, rather than a descriptive account of how reality actually is." Thrower also clarified for me the thought that I have always had that "atheism" is not a satisfactory description of my own philosophy of life. "For if the assertion that there is a god is nonsensical, then the atheists assertion that there is no god is equally nonsensical, since it is only a significant proposition that can be significantly contradicted." Which implies that agnosticism is also ruled out. Instinctively, I have referred to myself as a non-theist rather than atheist. After reading Thrower, I am even more comfortable referring to myself as an unbeliever or Humanist without any further qualifications. I highly recommend this book for those who are either theist or humanist in their belief because it gives a wonderful overview of the history of these two different views of our human awareness. For the theist, it provides a fresh look at the "old arguments" against religion and will help to sharpen or deepen your faith (since I doubt those of true faith will be persuaded against their faith by a review of atheisms history). For the humanist, it will provide roots for your own life philosophy. An excellent addition to both libraries!      ',nonspam

This is becoming must reading for the consultants in our new firm. While the point of view of most of the book is from that of an "inside" consultant, the principles and ideas are directly related to external consultants as well. The layout of this book makes it an invaluable reference with easy to find topics, checklists, and guides for consultants. A final checklist is provided in the appendix that comprises all the information covered in the body of the book. The final list cross references back to the appropriate chapters so that as you go through the process of Flawless Consulting, you can easily review the material presented. Flawless Consulting encourages us to make sure that WE are NOT the cause of failure to either land a consultancy or properly implement once we do have the contract. But the best idea presented is that the secondary goal of consultancy is to teach clients how to solve the problem themselves the next time! Consultants are advised to be authentic, including stating their own needs at the appropriate times. Mr. Block provides real world examples to back up his theories and positions. I especially enjoyed the list of "organizational codes" that he gave with respect to communications: When people mean "I dont like it," they express it by saying "I dont understand it." Or when they mean "I dont want to do it," they will say, "Lets get more data," or "Ill get back to you," or "Let me talk it over with my staff." Whether dealing with resistance to change, how to listen actively, or how implementations go awry, Blocks clear style and no nonsense approach to solving problems will serve internal and external consultants well and will undoubtedly provide superior results for the clients.

This wonderful book is a great companion to The Age of Spiritual Machines and in many respects, updates some of the science of that volume. But of interest to me is the discussion of all the competing moral values that we will have to face as we move forward with genetic manipulation of our genetic material and that of other animals and plants. Baldi has achieved his goal of making the book very readable for the lay person while compiling additional details in the appendices for those a bit more interested delving into the details. His thoughts are clear and articulate as he lays out the pros and cons of several competing moral values we face now and those we might face in the future. Baldi does not shy away from the long controversial or taboo subjects. His comments on sex are cogent and up to date. For example, he states; "Sexual and reproductive issues have long affected our societies in ways that created tensions between 5the sexes and were not always favorable to women. After all, even today in many countries men earn higher salaries than women for the same jobs. This is hard to justify from first principles in democratic societies, which are supposed to be founded on equality among humans." He then goes on to explain how cloning technology will further strain the relationship as the sexual act itself becomes unnecessary for evolution or preservation of genetic material. We are also warned that, "In this new reality [biotechnologies and the internet] of more or less continuous genotypes and phenotypes, all kinds of new creatures are beginning to pop up at a rapid pace, forcing us to revise our concepts, our laws, and our sense of whatever makes us human." This book should be on the must read list for any person interested in the establishment of ethical processes and models that allow us to choose between competing moral values.      ',nonspam

I was privileged to hear her speak and found that it was easier to absorb what she had to say in lecture than it was to absorb what she has written in this excellent book. Perhaps that was because there was so little time to go back over what she said where with this book I found myself review the material several times before I was satisfied. And there is no end to interesting concepts, ideas and models to keep one interested. One of the first "ah ha" moments was when Dr. Primavesi stated that "The acceptance of this truth within situations by scientists today means, for them, that the epoch of certainties and absolute oppositions is over."  She then goes on to point out that we are "inside the truth" and not separable from it, so that all we can do is define a truth from within the situation. This of course applies to not only our science, but our understanding of our evolutionary processes, and our theology. She sees that human language, that vehicle we use to communicate ideas, thoughts, and experiences, anthropomorphizes all that we try to verbalize. Thus we cannot avoid the appearance of separation of ourselves from our environment. As she moves on into the religious aspects of our struggle with good and evil, Dr. Primavesi states that "The complexity of interactions in our world is such that their outcomes, their effect-explosions, can never adequately computed, represented or predicted by us. This realization lay at the heart of Darwins dissatisfaction with the insufficiency of human reason as an instrument for understanding the universe." And she concludes that even today, with all our scientific progress, we underestimate the issue of our being in this world and what we do to it, ourselves, and our progeny as we live our daily lives. We fail to look at the whole complex system as one interdependent system.  Sacred Gaia presents us with a model that affirms life as a continuous gift and points out the implications of such a model for religious understanding of our existence. A most profound and engaging book.      ',spam

This book was recommended by a new friend and mentor and it has been timely indeed. The work that Daniel Pink has done to document the new business model sweeping America will undoubtedly have detractors and naysayers. Yet it fits with my own experience in the high technology market in which I have spent more than thirty years. Mr. Pink points out that the largest employer in the U.S. is Milwaukees Manpower, Inc. and that two out of three workers in California do not hold traditional jobs. These facts, combined with the aging of the American Workforce, the need for more family friendly schedules, and advancing technology makes for a powerful prediction that more and more American workers will be Free Agents in the next century.  This book is full of interesting factoids, anecdotal data, and documented trends that not only make the point for Free Agency, but is convincing for the predictions made. The format of the book is also useful in that each chapter ends with "The Box."  This summary includes "The Crux," which is the salient point of the chapter; "The Factoid," which is a major and usually surprising fact that supports the crux of the chapter; "The Quote," which is also lifted out of the chapter and serves to support the conclusions; and "The Word," which is usually a new word or phrase that Mr. Pink believes can be moved into the lexicon of the Free Agent.  A timely and useful book and one that all managers (who are toast according to Mr. Pink) and employees alike must take the time to read. Whether or not you are or plan to be a Free Agent, this book will prove extremely useful in understanding our workplace and the emerging economy.      ',spam

And things get better from there! This tightly argued book puts into words what many of us seem to struggle with in our discussions of good and evil, sin, and meaning in life. Holloway has recently stepped down as Bishop of Edinburgh. He is "one of the most outspoken and best-loved figures in the modern church." And I had the privilege of hearing him speak recently at a seminar on the future of faith. It is perhaps because I heard him expound upon his views that I learned so much by going back to read his book. Yet I find the writing to be clear and convincing on its own. I was shocked and pleased to read this from the good Bishops pen: "Paradoxically, it is scripture itself that calls us to overturn scripture; it is the witness of the living word of Jesus that challenges us to follow the logic that scripture was made for humanity and not humanity for scripture." These are courageous words indeed for a Bishop to write and preach. He deserves praise and support for this stand.     Richard Holloway challenges us on many levels of our daily lives. He changes our concept of how to choose between competing moral values (often good values, not straight good versus straight evil). He makes us think about our institutions of marriage, church, and government as the recipient of our moral judgments and challenges us to live up to the responsibility with a Godless Morality.

It is like reading a novel in CNN headline news format. There are about five parallel stories intertwined with short chapters on each. There is little warning or way of identifying which character or story line you are following at any one time.      But while the story itself was somewhat difficult, the theology is right on. At the end, our main character, a Priest now converting to Judaism, gives a bit of a sermon at his wedding to the beautiful, intelligent, Rabbi. He has just cited a long list of the worlds murderers and dictators and their atrocities, and then says:  "Do you not find this a grave challenge to your existence, Lord, that we do these things to one another? That for all our theological excuse making, and despite the moral struggles and the intellectual and technical advances of human history, we live enraged--quietly or explosively, but always greedily enraged? Do you not find it an unforgivable lapse of Yours that after these thousands of years we can no more explain ourselves than we can explain You?"     One of the credits on the back cover states that City of God is the crowning achievement of E.L. Doctorows career--"an astonishing modern masterwork of faith, mystery, and the search for spiritual authenticity." I cannot vouch for all of Doctorows works.

In this well written book, he attempts to pull together our experience in this modern world with a belief in God. He uses the "model" of scientific thinking to support his theological thinking.      Many of the writers on my book page are taken to task here, and I admit to having a bit of a struggle following all of Rev. Dr. Polinghornes logic. In the end, I was not convinced, yet the writing is compelling and I have now gone through much of the book several times over. I was looking for an understanding of ancient scripture that breaths new meaning for today. And indeed, some cases of "updated thinking" has given new life to the stories and metaphors of the Christian scriptures of my youth. But some must simply be abandoned. There is precedent to do so. Yet we seem, as a people, to stubbornly hold onto other literal interpretations and it gets us cross-wise of our intellectual understanding.      Polkinghorne has received recognition from the Templeton Foundation for this work. No doubt it is well deserved. For example, Polkinghorne has this to say about an updated Christian view: "A credible eschatology, which takes account of the eventual death of the universe and looks beyond it to Gods new creation, is surely an indispensable component in realistic Christian thinking."      Still, I am not convinced that he has shed any light for the belief in God in an age of Science. Despite his credentials in science, his theology gave me no sound logic for "proving" the existence of God. In the end, it is still a matter of faith - you either believe it, or you do not. You either have it, or you do not and this book, to my understanding, did not change the picture for me. Yet I highly regard and highly recommend this book to you!      ',nonspam

This is definitely a book that will remain close at hand as I struggle through my meditation practice (such as it is, or isnt at times!). This guidebook helps to set up a meaningful meditation practice that will achieve results and give direction to the hard work of analysis and finding inner truth. The author writes clearly and makes difficult mental images come alive. Stephen Batchelor claims that "Ken McLeods eminently practical manual goes straight to the heart of what the Buddha taught." Becoming fully alive, living joyfully and with compassion are goals that the reader can clearly see being set out and achieved. But this is hard work. I have read through the book once, but must read each step in the practice to keep on track. I think that this will be a life time endeavor and will, as pointed out in many places, eventually require a teacher.      ',nonspam

In Rescuing the Bible, Bishop Spong certainly doesnt disappoint those of us who follow him and his refreshing look at Christian scriptures. This is definitely a work for those who wish to reclaim some meaning in the ancient scriptures in light of our modern world and our own life experiences in this post-modern environment. One doesnt have to abandon scripture to make sense out of the real meaning behind the stories, one simply needs to understand the context and accept that things are a bit different today. You must read this volume if you are a serious Biblical scholar - even if you disagree completely, it is worth understanding an alternative point of view. Be not afraid, Bishop Spong is striving to bring Christianity and the Bible to life for modern people. This is a revival, not a wake!      ',nonspam

Ive enjoyed every book he has recommended so far, and this book is no exception. In fact, I have ordered several additional copies and given them out as gifts. This is definitely a challenging read, but puts things in perspective in regards to the question of "Why are we the way we are?" Not an easy read, but the effort pays off with new insights into our human nature and some of the biological and environmental reasons we think and act in our own unique manner. One cannot, I think, read this volume without coming face to face with the reality that we are all responding, at different levels, to programming from our genes and our environment. The decisions we make between competing moral values is truly a mixture of those program subroutines we are not even aware are running in our "computer brain." There is not much comfort for those looking for a "meaning" to life, or simple answers about our interaction with our environment. But if one sticks with the author, the reward is a bit of insight into the real Darwinian equation. One notable quotation concerning free will versus determinism, Wright notes that: "Darwin saw all of this. He didnt know about genes, but he certainly knew about the concept of heredity, and he was a scientific materialist; he didnt think any nonphysical forces were needed to explain human behavior, or anything else in the natural world." Be prepared to be enlightened. This is a must read for anyone seriously pursuing knowledge of our human nature.      ',spam

I must say, it has truly captured my attention even though Im not a history buff. And it has lived up to its reputation as being well written and very interesting. The liberal use of quotations from Adams letters has made this book a window into the life and times of John Adams and I am thoroughly delighted to have read it. I do recommend using an electronic version if you have the equipment.   One is struck with the incredible integrity of John Adams and his faithful use of his ethical system. He was almost always consistent in his approach to problems and was therefore dependable and predictable. His commitment to our country was nothing short of monumental and in these trying times, it is good to read of a true patriot who understood that he and his country had to be held to a very high standard indeed. McCulloughs book is definitely worth the time to read and one should not be put off by its size, the time will fly more quickly than you can imagine.      ',nonspam

This book was a gift from a dear friend, and what a gift it has turned out to be. I will always be mindful of the difference between climbing Jacobs Ladder and dancing Sarahs Circle. It is such a perfect metaphor for the lives we have built. It is especially poignant to have read this volume and finished it so close to the recent tragedies here in the US on 9/11/01. It makes me wonder exactly how much of the hate directed at our country is due to the Jacobs Ladder world we have created. It is high time that we paid attention to dancing instead of climbing. Matthew had so much to teach me about compassion - that it is not pity but celebration, not sentiment but making justice and doing works of mercy, and that it is not private or ego-centric but public. Then Matthew helps us to understand how the teachings in our culture, that of ever climbing - the ladders of success or acquisitions - and distancing ourselves from others and how those teachings separate us from compassion, can be a significant cause of pain in our world. Many of us know the song to which Matthew refers: We are climbing Jacobs Ladder / Soldiers of the Cross. We may not be familiar with the corollary to that song (sung to the same tune): We are Dancing Sarahs Circle / Sisters, Brothers, All. The message of this book - give up being "Soldiers of the Cross," and instead become "Sisters, Brothers, All," is definitely a message for our time.      ',spam

I got started on Dennetts many books when a friend recommended Consciousness Explained and I havent been able to put the topic down ever since. Dennett continues his clear, straightforward style in this book which is much more readable than Consciousness Explained, but still provides ample challenge for the reader.  Dennett starts with the statement, "I am a philosopher, not a scientist," yet his command of what is going on in the sciences is most impressive. His ability to make incredibly complex ideas of evolution understandable to the lay person is amazing and consistent. Through the use of words and diagrams, we are brought up to date on the latest thinking on what mind is and how it is evolving. Kinds of Minds tackles very emotional and controversial topics such as "are we so sure that all humans have minds? . . . Could it be that all animals and even plants and even bacteria have minds?. . . What kinds of minds are there?" The reader is then lead through a series of logical steps, replete with information on the latest scientific and philosophical thought, and left to finally decide these big questions on his or her own.  This is definitely a must read book for those interested in the human mind, consciousness, and ethical treatment of our fellow beings in this interconnected web of all existence.      ',nonspam

I found the book so interesting that I immediately purchased a copy for myself along with the rest of the series! I am not a history buff and usually do not spend much time reading history. Yet this historical fiction of the people of the North American continent caught my imagination and provided grist for the mill in a recent presentation I made on the origins of consciousness.  A very well written story with detail of the lives of our ancient ancestors and how we might have lived, evolved, and dreamed. It is refreshing to have a shared hero and heroine, with the story of how our patriarchal society might have also evolved from the life of hunter-gatherers.  The Gears bring their considerable knowledge to bare in the weaving of this intriguing story of our heritage. It is obvious that they have paid attention to the details and are trying to put together the most plausible explanation of how life might have been in the transition from the last ice age. The people live in clans and are dependent upon each other for survival. They struggled for leadership just as any other group of humans and fought over the viability for the best ideas of survival. They fought change, they tried hard to maintain their contact with the spiritual side of existence and they were deeply respectful of life.  We follow the mammoth hunters as they struggle for survival during the stress of "others" forcing them from their normal hunting grounds and camps. They struggle with the balance of peaceful coexistence and warring to protect the life they know. And then they face the incredible challenge of going against all their accumulated knowledge to follow Wolf Dreamer under the ice to a new land. In many ways, this is a perfect "Campbell hero story" and as such, is inspiring, interesting, and has lessons for us even in this far removed time. I am looking forward to the rest of the series.      ',nonspam

Personally, I do not know how one writes an autobiography in a humble way, while still standing for your point of view in how events unfolded. In many ways, this book falls into all the traps of the typical autobiography, but the theology was so interesting and the politics of the Episcopal church so intriguing that I found I could not put the book down. "The heart cannot worship what the mind rejects," declares this Bishop as he goes about trying to move his church into the 21st century - without much success most times. The story of his wifes illness, and subsequent death, made me want to know more about how the stress of being "the Bishops wife" might have added to her suffering. Not to place blame, but rather to understand and apply lessons to my own life and marriage. And I could not help but identify strongly with the frustration of trying to move a large organization forward. Much of my professional life deals with trying to manage change in organizations, and it seems an overwhelming, thankless, and impossible task at times. In a way, it was helpful to find that it is not only the for profit world that struggles with power, change, and integrity. Since I have had the pleasure of hearing Bishop Spong speak, and the distinct honor to meet him for a brief one on one discussion, I found that I could "hear his voice" as I read this book. I could "see" the sparkle in his eye as he took on some of the antagonists in his story. His theology is considered liberal by almost any standard. I find that not only refreshing, but the only hope we have of saving religious institutes as we go forward. If we do not update our theology, we will be destined to follow England into a secular, non-churched society. I agree with Bishop Spong that "The heart cannot worship what the mind rejects." Get it and read it and understand the message.      ',nonspam
' A103U0Q3IKSXHE	0316180661	July 27, 2001	12	17	4.0	A new model to consider . . .	 Mr. Daniel C. Dennett is also author of Brainstorms and coauthor of The Minds I. George Johnson, New York Times Book Review stated that this book was "Brilliant . . as audacious as its title . . ." and I could not agree more. This text is well written and put together in such a manner that the concepts are accessible even to those of us who are not scientists by training. Yet, the change in the model of the brain presented here is very difficult for me to grasp. I like the concept of thinking about a massively parallel processor as the model for how the brain does what it does, but translating that into a new concept of no one central place where "consciousness takes place," is very difficult indeed. Like many, my view of human consciousness was that there was a central place, an observer that kept me neatly in time and space. Not so, says Dennett.     "Each normal individual of this species [homo sapiens]," says Mr. Dennett, "makes a self. Out of its brain it spins a web of words and deeds, and, like the other creatures, it doesnt have to know what it is doing; it just does it. This web protects it, just like the snail shell, and provides it a livelihood, just like the spiders web, and advances its prospects for sex, just like the bowerbirds bower." He goes on to point out that this web of discourse and deeds is as much a biological product as any of the other constructions to be found in the animal world.     Mr. Dennett goes on to explain that this complex set of cultural transmissions (memes) such as tunes, ideas, catch-phrases, clothes fashions, etc. can best be understood as the operation of a "von Neumannesque" virtual machine implemented in the parallel architecture of a brain that was not designed for any such activities. In other words, we have learned to use our brains for new functions as we evolved. And, as we spin this web of discourse, we create for ourselves a sense of time-space and orient ourselves in that time-space in such a way as to disconnect ourselves from "creation" and give ourselves and others a sense of "individual."     The book concludes with appendices that direct themselves to specialized language and explanations for Philosophers and Scientists. All in all, a very difficult but rewarding read. I found this book challenging to say the least, and yet I highly recommended it to those interested in how the evolution of human consciousness. ',nonspam

In Digital Darwinism, we are presented with "7 breakthrough business strategies for surviving in the cutthroat web economy." They are: 1. Build a grand that stands for solving problems 2. Allow your prices to fluctuate freely with supply and demand. 3. Let affiliate partners do your marketing for you. 4. Create valuable bundles of information and services. 5. Sell custom-made products online, then manufacture them. 6. Add new value to transactions between buyers and sellers. 7. Integrate digital commerce with absolutely everything.     From a technical point of view, I found little new in these strategies, but perhaps that is because I work in a technology field. For those who are trying to bring a "old economy" business into the "new economy," this book will be a valuable source of ideas for the inevitable culture shock.     The writing style is clean and concise, and the ideas are clearly presented, illustrated with examples, and brought to us in a believable story form. Even the typeface and page layout make this book easy to read. At the end of each chapter appears a short summary of the key points which can easily serve as a quick refresher when thinking through the implementation of new strategies.     In the end, one must remember that the very lessons of the author will also render his book short lived. Things will change (and are already)! But there are definitely some principles for how to think about this new, evolving digital world that will help us move forward and maintain our position in the evolution of this digital world.

This excellent volume is replete with personal stories, examples from real life mens support groups, and knowledgeable advice from a practicing therapist. It was, apparently, first published as "In the Company of Men." Mr. Allen presents material here that may not at first seem new to anyone reading in mens studies these days. But the added value is in the second half of the book where, after convincing us that there are serious reasons to consider why men suppress their feelings, he gives us some ideas of how to break through the barriers. He explains how we will be able to open up to a full range of feelings if we simply stop accepting "the rules written on The Man Box" were in. Just as the womens movement has begun to dismantle the systemic reasons for being put in "the Woman Box," men are encouraged to review how and why we are so well indoctrinated by society to fill the stereotype of "man." We have to start at home and in the society at large to correct limiting views while saving the good aspects of being male. "What men need to do," Allen tells us, "is draw some distinctions between beliefs and behaviors they want to keep and ones they want to discard. For example, they may see that being able to hide their feelings in a poker game or in the middle of a business deal works to their advantage; there are times when its important not to show your hand. But hiding their feelings from their wives and their friends keeps them isolated and alone." I suppose the best recommendation, or review, of this book I can give you is to mention that I have ordered a dozen copies (from Amazon.com of course!) to give to friends and to use in my own mens group. I recommend this excellent work for any man or woman interested in learning more about the male psychology.      ',nonspam

I found this book to be very well written with a rather unique approach of using a "composite character" with whom the author has first a dialogue on a question and then for whom he provides a more thorough essay answer. The reader is caught up in this give and take between professor and student, and the questions are the hard ones! Why Christian? Why Jesus? Saved from What and for What? Why Church? Is there Hope? There are many selected biblical quotations with a clear explanation written in such a way as to leave room for the reader to differ. In almost all cases, respect for other faith systems is maintained, reserving the most direct criticism for the authors own beloved Christianity. Professor Hall recognizes many of the atrocities committed in the name of religions, including Christianity, and explains why such actions are inconsistent with the precepts of those religions. He discusses how birthright so often is a reason for starting out in a religion but how today especially, birthright alone is not enough to keep someone in a given faith system. Appropriately, some of the more fundamental questions are left to the reader to answer. For example, " So what precisely (as we may ask with Wendell Berry and others) are human beings for? If we are not just accidents of nature, what is our place in the scheme of things? What is our purpose and how could we attain it, or reclaim it?" This question is never really answered directly, but is diverted to a related "sense of anxiety" angle. My belief is that this book will be a bit of a disappointment for those looking to find a dogmatic statement of why Christian today. Instead, one finds a respectful questioning of todays Christianity with a deep routed love of what Christianity can be. This is indeed a wonderful resource "for those on the edge of faith."

I had the pleasure of hearing Professor Cupitt speak at a seminar not long ago, and I find his writing as interesting as his presentation. It helps, too, that I now can hear his voice as I read his book. Each sentence is packed and must be carefully unpacked in order to get the full meaning of his statements. But the effort is worth it since, as you work through the dense words, you begin to see a full picture of the Kingdom Religion that Don Cupitt believes to be so vital to the reformation of Christianity. I refer to such statements such as: "All the doctrinal themes are meant gradually to sink in and become part of ones own being - which gives rise to the paradox that when you have fully become a Christian, you arent one any longer." And this: "I have already said that in the process of its reformation, Christianity has to move on from its ecclesiastical period, its schooldays, now ending, to its fully adult form, the kingdom religion that Jesus originally lived, preached and hoped to see on earth." I can think of no other way to get across the new ideas and directions for Christianity than the way Professor Cupitt takes. His well structured thoughts in this logically laid out volume helps put things in perspective. And though I found some of the ideas  difficult to grasp at first reading, subsequent study made them so with little "Ah Ha!" moments. Overall I have to rate this excellent work at least a 4 on a scale of 5. I hope it gets to your reading list for the hard work of continuing on your spiritual path.      ',nonspam

However, I have found the advice to be timeless and in keeping with that given by modern writers such as Stephen King and Natalie Goldberg. Dorothea Brande writes in clear, concise terms what is needed to become a writer, and like the others, she advises that hard work is what will in the end, be a necessary ingredient. Especially if we are to be conscious competents. I found the chapters on reading as a writer most helpful as I do so much reading and therefore wish to learn as much as I can while doing so. And I was most amazed at the insight that Ms. Brande had with respect to how the mind works. She seems to be well ahead of her times, and Im not so sure that many would find fault with her take on how genius or "empty mind" is to be encouraged and enhanced. In short, this book is well worth the read and should be on any aspiring writers shelf.

As I continued to read, it dawned on me that this is a perfect title in that while a very broad range of topics relating to the history of Jesus, the Bible, the Church, and various forms of Christianity are covered, they are not covered in depth. Rather, Dr. Laughlin manages to give us enough information to make us stop and think and thirst for more. It would be easy to lapse into well deserved accolades over this book, but suffice it to say that it was exceedingly difficult to put it down and I found myself not able to read two other books at the same time as this one, as would be my normal custom.          I cant help giving an excerpt that is, to me, an outstanding example of the clear and forthright prose from this scholar:                "While the thorough going skepticism of many Unitarian-Universalist may  be too radical for most Christians, it is quite clear that Christianity has taken a turn in that direction and will have to embrace the attitude of Liberalism in a major and deliberate way in order to survive, prosper, and maintain its relevancy in the Third Millennium. The modern scientific world view is simply too pervasive, productive, and compelling to ignore; and all of us reared in the West are so acculturated into it that we simply accept it as the way the world operates. Any religion -- Christian or otherwise -- that demands of its followers that they deny their senses and minds in  order to believe, or that tries to shield them from the prevailing worldview, is doomed to anachronism, retrogression, and eventual oblivion."          And there are many more worthwhile gems of wisdom and scholarly corrections to common misperceptions about the many different faces of Western Christianity. This book is logically organized, clearly documented with excellent exercises at the end of each chapter. It comes complete with wonderful bibliography and glossary of terms. It will take every lay-person with the curiosity to learn more about Christianity to the next level of understanding.           My sincere wish is that so many Christians, and those of other religious paths, read and learn from this book that a grass roots movement to modernize this wonderful religion takes place. Simply a marvelous text.      ',spam

At the same time, this book is perhaps the most interesting explanation of Zen practice that Ive read in a long time. By weaving her own story of Zen practice with the principles of writing and giving vision to how each is connected to the other, Goldberg draws the reader into an appreciation of both disciplines.           I found myself mourning just as she described herself to be at the loss of Kitigari Roshi. Somehow, Goldberg had gotten me to be as much in love with Roshi as she, and so the loss was real when she described the events leading up to and then his actual death.  But that is exactly what she tries to explain in the Long Quiet Highway, that we have to experience now, and be open to the present fully, unconditionally. The beauty of this book is that it not only explains in mere words the principles she espouses, but it elicits those feelings directly through the very words we are reading.          Easy insight comes also from her teaching experiences. That is not to imply that the lessons learned were easy for Ms. Goldberg, but rather that her word pictures make it easy for the reader to understand and visualize what actually happened, what lights went on with the students, and how she managed to make that happen. I thought that I would perhaps be a bit bored with this, her fourth book for me, but I could not have been more incorrect.           This book has inspired me to go back and re-read some of the Zen texts Ive collected. At the same time, it has encouraged me to make time for my own writing practice - no excuses, no postponing, just do it.      ',nonspam

' A103U0Q3IKSXHE	0944344801	April 3, 2001	13	13	5.0	Let your enemies love you!	 The Once and Future Jesus is a compendium of presentations given at one of the many Jesus Seminars. The writing is insightful, in depth, concise, and enlightening. This is must reading for anyone serious about bible study. Each of the contributors to this book sheds new and different light on what I once thought I understood. The gems almost slip by you, such as this one from Robert Funk:  "Love your enemies is probably the most radical thing Jesus ever said. Unless, of course, one considers the parable of the Samaritan. There the admonition is to let your enemies love you." Perhaps this is not a new slant for many readers, but for me, it was a fresh way to view a wonderful, familiar parable. And it is so good to have a female point of view. Karen L. King, in Back to the Future, opens our minds to the gospel of Mary and how the "basis for leadership lay in a persons spiritual maturity, not any ephemeral physical characteristic like gender or sexuality." And of course, the indomitable Bishop John Shelby Spong gives the reader hope for the survival of Christianity in his essay, Christ and the Body of Christ.  And Lloyd Geering point out in The Legacy of Christianity that "It was the ancient Israelites who abolished the gods of nature who prevented humans from interfering with their domain. It was the ancient Israelites who declared that humans had been given dominion over the earth by its one and only Creator. It was the ancient Israelites who desacralized the sun, moon, and heavenly bodies and proclaimed that the heavens and the earth belonged to one created system." This small book, packed with new insight, was for me an excellent read.      ',spam

Despite the hazards, the authors bravely predict what is going to happen with some very interesting developments in the business world. Probable Tomorrows was interesting to read since it was written in 1997 and made some predictions for "today" that we can use as a benchmark for accuracy. And all in all, the predictions were good. The tables at the end of the book, and the timeline for changes can be used to help us see what we might need to do to update our company strategies (as outlined in a recent book e-Strategy).       Some of the topics discussed here were expanded upon in the futuristic book The Age of Spiritual Machines by Ray Kurzweil. Between these two books, a broad brush look at what we are in store for emerges and may indeed give us some hints on how to formulate business strategy to take us into the future. Overall, I would rate this book a 3 out of 5. It was well written and easy  to read, but books that attempt to forecast the future are qickly dated.      ',nonspam

This remarkable little book has done more to enhance my understanding of Buddhism and my own Judeo-Christian heritage than I could have imagined. Karen Armstrongs clear and concise writing lead me through some interpretations of the Buddhas life that had never occurred to me and has pointed out some of the same "problems" that I have had with other "sacred" writings.      I have come to appreciate the mythical proportions of the story of Siddhatta Gotama, and realize now that there are as many unknowns about his life as there are about Jesus or other ancient prophets. The story of Siddhattas originally sheltered life of prince who saw the injustice and suffering in the world, went of to gain special powers, and then came back to "save the people" follows the Joseph Campbell heros story. In addition, it is a story that was often told in Buddhas time. It is a metaphor for the human mind awakening to the suffering in the world caused by our own acquisitiveness.       Then too, those disciples left after Buddhas death slowly deified him by embellishing the story and expanding it as needed to include the prejudices of those in power at the time of the telling or recording. Gotama did not want deification or a religious cult following. Nevertheless, just as with Jesus and Christianity, those that were left used the hero story to their own ends. They built a two tier order with special education and in depth understanding of the mystical nature of Dhamma for the Bhikkhus and a more lenient worldly teaching for the lay followers.      Like most axial period religions, Bhuddism was not inclusive of women. The contradiction is blatant in that Buddha taught that the Dhamma was open to everybody: gods, animals, robbers, men of all castes - so were women to be excluded? And under what logic? When he was finally convinced that he was wrong not to allow women into the Sangha, Buddha set much stricter rules that subjugated the nuns to the bhikkhu. In other words, the women were once again relegated to second class citizenship in the Buddhist world.      An excellent book with new, fresh insight into this most interesting philosophy. And it is especially interesting to read after hearing Ms. Armstrong speak and learning a little bit about her as a person. A most remarkable opportunity that I can only hope will come again in the future.      ',nonspam
' A103U0Q3IKSXHE	0060675365	March 17, 2001	17	34	5.0	Loving Wastefully	 This is definitely a book that opened my mind to new views of the Christian Bible. I have long said that while I think there are good lessons in the Bible, it cannot, and should not be taken literally, nor be considered to be inerrant in content. Because I had neither the time nor inclination to become a New Testament Scholar, I had no way to verbalize my belief or argue with those who professed to "Know." Here then, is a book that a lay person can read, understand, and evaluate based on your own common sense. More importantly, this book has given me a whole new way to view Jesus and perhaps be more accepting of his lessons. Bishop Spong uses the phrase "Christian in exile" to describe how he feels. He is in exile because much, if not all, of the organized Christian religion today calls for us to believe in things that require us to suspend our common sense. Yet, many are also not comfortable leaving the faith of their childhood. So perhaps they sit quietly or say the words of the liturgy while footnoting in their minds what the "really" think is true. Bishop Spong also chooses to use the words "Ground of Being" to express more clearly his concept of God. In the preface to the book, Bishop Spong states, "This book has been in progress for more than twenty years. It is a work of faith and conviction. It is my witness as one who desires to worship as a citizen of the modern world and to be able to think as I worship. I write it as a person to whom the Christian Church has accorded honor, rank, and the privilege of leadership in the episcopal office. It comes thus from the life of a bishop whose vows at the time of my consecration included both a promise to defend the faith and to guard the unity of the church. The vocation of doing just that in a rapidly changing world has been my privilege for almost a quarter of a century." And in this book he does indeed defend the faith - against the establishment that tries to keep the faith by ignoring the realities of our modern world. As he states, Christianity must change, or it will, inevitably, die. I would expand that to say any religion today must take into account our growing understanding of our physical world. If, in my youth, I had ministers who thought as clearly as Bishop Spong does now, I might still be in the Christian faith. But, like so many of my friends, even those still attending a Christian church, I refuse to check my brain at the door. Now I find that I have more time to explore my own spirituality, read those who have made theology their life, and further, I am in a position to process all this with a mind free of dogmatic interpretations. It is too late for me to return to Christianity, but I can now reclaim Jesus as a peripatetic sage who has many lessons worth learning. I hope that those still practicing Christian faith will help open the minds of their peers to read the scriptures with new eyes, keeping their faith living and healthy - with no congregants checking their brains at the door. Thank you Bishop Spong for having the courage to write this book, for having the courage to go on saying what you believe despite sixteen death threats from bible quoting Christians, and for loving us wastefully enough to want to bring meaning into our post modern lives.

' A103U0Q3IKSXHE	0375411127	March 11, 2001	5	5	4.0	Why am I working so many hours?	 If you have been working more and enjoying it less, or even if youve been enjoying it more, this book can explain why. Well documented and reasonably argued positions on why the "new economy" is going in the direction it is provides insights into the phenomena we are likely all to be experiencing at work, but have not been able to figure out ourselves. Robert Reich takes us through the history of how we got here as well as the common misconceptions of our times. He points out, for example, that contrary to popular belief todays innovators are not necessarily particularly adept at using new information technology. He points out that they are creative workers. He then breaks the creative workers into two groups defined as "Geeks," and "Shrinks." The Geeks provide the creative innovations from a technology point of view, but the Shrink provides the marketing intelligence as to what people really want for the product or service. Reichs thesis is that technology is speeding and broadening access to "terrific deals." That is driving everything including worker mobility since they are selling their own services. The look for the best deal as an employee much as the employer looks for the best deal in materials as well employees. One of the difficulties facing workers in this new age is that they will not be able to predict their "bottom line" income. Because payment is based on value added at almost all levels of the economy, your annual income will depend on a great many changing parameters. To put it in his terms, "the fabulous new deals of the fabulous new economy carry a steep price: more frenzied lives, less security, more economic and social stratification, the loss of time and energy for family, friendship, community and self." We must all be aware of this change and manage the high touch part of our high tech lives.      ',nonspam

Having read this book, with some difficulty in sticking to it, I have to admit that the word "shrill," comes to mind. I was disappointed with how Mr. Smith tried to approach this subject and confess to having learned a great deal more reading David Ray Griffins book Religion and Scientific Naturalism. At least there, concrete steps for both Religion and Science were given. Mr. Smith, using broken flashlight analogies, diatribes against science, and references to fictional books (Kingsolver) tries to build a case for traditionalism. He is far from successful.  Still, there are passages that do provide some food for thought and a bit of enlightenment. I was looking for more concrete understanding of the opposing views. In the end, Mr. Smith seems to lay the whole responsibility for reconciling science and religion at sciences door. Intuitively, one knows that religion owns some of the problems with the reconciliation, so what are they? Perhaps theologians have enough "world view" to understand how science can coexist with religion, but what about the masses who have to live every day with the conflicts between what they observe, what is accepted knowledge, what is practical and what is the religious instruction given to them to believe? I did not find real help with these questions.      ',nonspam
' A103U0Q3IKSXHE	155963779X	January 3, 2001	9	11	5.0	Our many complex natures	 According to Jared Diamond, "The one book to read on human evolution." Human Natures is clear, quite readable, and concise thus bringing a difficult subject into focus. Ehrlich disabused me of several notions that I had built up over many years of reading about evolution in various publications. No longer will I blame "genes" for everything that goes right and wrong in my life or the lives of those around me. Certainly, genes will still hold a prominent position in my understanding of human natures (plural, for there are many), but our environment will be moved up as at least an equal partner. Here is an example of his excellent style; Ehrlich writes (page 119 & 120):  "Despite the uncertainties, several general points with particular evolutionary relevance about the mechanisms of the human brain seem quite will established. In summary, they key points are as follows:    1. The brain is an organ that, like other organs, has evolved a structure that serves its various functions.    2. The brain can compensate for partial damage and, often, keep thinking.    3. The brain has many "programs"--connected sets of neurons--that have been built in over hundreds of millions of years by natural selection.    4. More recently evolved programs in the brain enable us to solve problems of relationships and causation that are difficult or impossible for other animals to solve.    5. Although selection has led to these capabilities by creation of appropriate genotypes, appropriate environments (both internal and external) are essential to produce the  behavioral characteristics we observe.    6. Natural selection has designed the brains programs to bias certain perceptions and behaviors.    7. Nonetheless, the genetic code does not build specific instructions into the brains structure for dealing with every conceivable behavioral situation or even large numbers of them.    8. Natural selection has trouble doing just one thing at a time with respect to the brain, just as with other organs. It is unlikely, for example, that selection could produce a brain program that predisposes females to desire males with curly hair without changing other programs of the brain or, perhaps, other aspects of the human phenotype."    Ehrlich then goes on to explain all these concepts in detail with easily understood supporting evidence, arguments, and theories. From genes, to religion, to cultures, our complex human natures are unraveled and put before us to see and recognize as the wonder they are. Evolution of the human species is explained in the timeframe and the manner supported by the best scientific evidence of the day. Yet, the wonder and mystery of sentient beings is not in any way denigrated. This is definitely a book to read, and perhaps the only one those of us not in the sciences needs to read for some time to come.      ',nonspam

"What would Jesus be doing," or "What would Jesus BE," is more appropriate. Journeymen is a spiritual guide for men, and for women who want to understand them. A gift, in more ways than one, this book has definitely added clarity to my spiritual journey. Seneca said: "Without knowing which port one is sailing toward, there is no such thing as a favorable wind." This book can help you understand the port for which you should be sailing, and helps you with the dead-reckoning along the way.  Modeled after 12 step programs, the book and its 12 chapters provide much for us to contemplate on our journey. Meditations, prayer practices, rest areas, and excursions provide variety on our way as well as many ideas for future excursions and side trips. But "Journeymen" is also another word for apprentices. And so, while this small, easily read volume will be a resource for our mens group for many months to come, it will also be a great individual resource for my own difficult individual soul work. It is well worth the read and serious consideration of todays renaissance man.      ',nonspam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	B00006469K	May 3, 2003	8	8	4.0	Decent "Don" at bargain price	 It takes a special kind of conductor to integrate the comedic and dramatic elements of Mozarts most Shakespearean opera.  Georg Solti, unfortunately, is not that conductor.  He takes a taut, driving view of the score which may be exciting to some listeners, but verges on the manic in my opinion.  Zerlina and Masettos entrance is so frantic that they sound like theyre preparing for a debauched Roman orgy rather than a peasant wedding. There are, however, two performances here which give unalloyed pleasure: Margaret Price as Donna Anna and Lucia Popp as Zerlina.  Both are among the top recorded interpreters of their roles.  Prices silvery, vibrant soprano moves effortlessly through Annas high tessitura, always beautifully controlled and dramatically alert.  There are no squally high notes or misjudged attacks - only Sutherland on the Giulini set is in Prices class.  Popp has a fuller voice than is often heard in Zerlinas music, (sopranos like Sciutti and Gueden sound tiny by comparison) but it pays off in the nuances and inflections she puts into the music.  She is both alluring and innocent at the same time.  Luckily, we get to hear her in even more of Zerlinas music than usual, as the duet with Leporello, "Per queste tue manine" is included. Sylvia Sass is dramatically potent and can float a lovely messa di voce, but she is a little woolly for Elvira - her best work has always been in Verdi.  Stuart Burrows as Ottavio sings beautifully, but fades into the background dramatically (although this is more the fault of the role itself than anything Burrows does).  The final touch of individuality is all he lacks to be in the front rank of Ottavios. Kurt Molls Commendatore is fine, but the other low voices disappoint.  Gabriel Bacquier and Alfred Sramek (Leporello and Masetto respectively) sing the notes but dont do much more than that.  Bernd Weikl is a frustrating Don - at times his voice is beautiful, but rarely does he allow himself a chance to simply sing.  Like Soltis conducting, Weikl pushes through the music, perhaps to indicate the Dons doomed character, but it is impossible to believe this man is a successful seducer.  Moments where he should ooze charm and suavity, such as "La ci darem" and the serenade, sound effortful and blatant (a pity, as Popp is exquisite in the duet). When everything is considered, I wouldnt want to be without this set for the superb performances of Price and Popp, and while Burrows, Moll, and Sass hold up their end of the show well, this cant be recommended as a first choice, although it could make a viable second choice to a favorite version.  Try the Giulini or Krips recordings to hear a more cohesive reading of Mozarts masterpiece. (Readers should be advised that this recording comes with a libretto that is accessible only through a CD-ROM drive)      ',nonspam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	1580811787	June 10, 2002	5	5	5.0	Absolutely riveting audio version	 John Pielmeiers play "Agnes of God" opened on Broadway in 1982 with a cast that included Elizabeth Ashley, Geraldine Page, and Amanda Plummer.  It tells the tale of a young novice who has been sheltered from the world all her life.  One night, she is found unconscious in her convent room after having given birth to a baby, which is found dead in a wastebasket.  This shocking incident gives rise to a whole set of questions: Who was the father?  Why did no one know about Agnes pregnancy?  Is she really as simple and naive as she seems?  And, most importantly, who killed the baby? The play features three terrific roles for actresses: Agnes, the Mother Superior, and the court-appointed psychiatrist, Dr. Livingstone.  The script is not without its flaws: the science vs. faith conceit is played out a little too simply, and some of the symbolism is heavy-handed to say the least (the doctor trades her obsessive chain-smoking for an obsessive fixation on Agnes).  The play was also made into a rather tepid movie which unwisely opened up the claustrophobic office/convent interview scenario and added superfluous characters and subplots.  Meg Tilly and Anne Bancroft both earned much-deserved Oscar nominations for their excellent performances, but Jane Fonda is miscast and less than obsessive in the role of Dr. Livingstone. This audio recording, however, makes one forget any flaws in the script and completely erases any sour memory of the misjudged film version.  It is gripping in every way.  Harriet Harris carries the show in a bravura performance as Dr. Livingstone ("X-files" fans will remember her from the terrific "Eve" episode).  She is not afraid to be curt and unlikable, and she carries a chip on her shoulder the size of a Buick.  Every shifting emotion is immediately audible in her highly expressive voice: wry condescenion, bitter regret, volcanic rage, and aching sorrow all come into play.  Her final, gut-wrenching monologue is absolutely harrowing.  With a performance like Harris, visuals become unnecessary. Harris force-of-nature portrayal could easily overwhelm less accomplished co-stars, but Barbara Bain and Emily Bergl more than hold their own.  Bain is sympathetic and likable as the Mother Superior, a welcome contrast to Harris caustic doctor.  She matches Harris step for step in their emotional confrontations and gives equal weight to the Mothers deep sense of spirituality and the earthier, more secular side of the character.  This is no caricature, but a flesh-and-blood human being. Emily Bergl (who was the one bright spot in the otherwise limp "The Rage: Carrie 2") makes a perfect Agnes: childlike, eager to please, and slightly otherworldly.  She gives her ludicrous answers to the doctors questions in such a matter-of-fact manner that one simply cant write her off as insane.  Because of her utter conviction in everything she says, we as listeners must at least consider the fact that the visions and voices she sees and hears might be real.  Bergl also fully commits to her emotional moments with the doctor.  Harris is often so brutal with the psychologically fragile Bergl that one almost wishes Child Protective Services would come in and whisk Agnes away.  Bergls singing voice -- an important aspect of Agnes character -- is childlike and unspoilt, adding to the sense of Agnes purity.   Sound effects are used sparingly but judiciously, such as the flick of a lighter letting the audience know that the doctor has lighted a cigarette.  Credit must be given to director Nancy Malone, who has shaped the rhythm and pace of the piece with the expert skill of an orchestral conductor.  Under her guidance, the three actresses sound like a finely-tuned ensemble, with Bains earthy alto, Harris reedy mezzo, and Bergls soft-grained soprano playing together as exquisitely as virtuoso instruments.  Audio theatre doesnt come any better than this.      ',spam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	B0000687EE	June 10, 2002	9	9	5.0	Magnificent	 Thank Heaven for Broadway Theatre Archive.  For the past few years, the company has been releasing older television productions of great stage works, as well as a select number of theatrically staged videos (such as the Shakespeare-in-the-Park productions of "King Lear" with James Earl Jones and "The Pirates of Penzance" with Kevin Kline and Linda Ronstadt).  Some of these television productions are truly legendary: Jason Robards in "The Iceman Cometh," and Robards and Colleen Dewhurst in the landmark production of "A Moon for the Misbegotten."  The present DVD edition of Tennessee Williams "Eccentricities of a Nightingale" deserves to join their ranks. "Nightingale" is Williams revision of 1948s "Summer and Smoke" (my favorite Williams play, incidentally).  It tells essentially the same story of the spinsterish ministers daughter whose consuming love for her next-door neighbor remains unreciprocated.  "Nightingale" is less allegorical than its predecessor and more tightly focused on the fascinating central character of Alma Winemiller, who Williams once claimed was his favorite character of all those that he had written. All the roles in this production are in eminently capable hands, with particular pride of place among the supporting players going to Louise Latham as the mentally unbalanced Mrs. Winemiller, Tim OConnor as Almas well-intentioned but misguided father, and Neva Patterson as the two-faced Mrs. Buchanan, oozing both Southern charm and venom.  As the object of Almas affections, Frank Langella plays the most warm and romantic John Buchanan I have ever seen.  Other Johns have seemed cocky or cold, but Langella seems to genuinely care about Alma rather than merely tolerating her.  Played like this, it is quite easy to see how Alma could fall in love with him. However, this is Almas show, and in that role Blythe Danner is a raw, exposed nerve-ending, alternating between lyric melancholy and barely concealed hysteria.  It is an exquisitely shaded performance, full of rich colors and nuance, and it is on a par with the sublime Geraldine Pages performance of the same role in the film version of "Summer and Smoke."  Both actresses capture the characters need to burst forth from her own skin, of being strait-jacketed by the social mores of the period, and of being on the precipice of a dangerous emotional drop-off point.  If Page owned the role of Alma in "Summer and Smoke," Danner clearly owns the Alma of "Eccentricities."  She is simply stunning. Dont expect stunning picture quality -- the production was filmed in 1976 on video, so it is roughly akin to watching a mid-1970s soap opera.  However, the performances are what matter here, and they truly deliver.  If you love Tennessee Williams, Blythe Danner, or if you simply enjoy great drama, dont let this one pass you by.      ',spam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	B00005B0CQ	March 12, 2002	10	10	5.0	My favorite "Boheme"	 In our age of international jet-setting, wunderkind conductors, concept-driven stage directors, and operatic superstars, sometimes it takes a performance that is over 60-years old to remind one just how good an opera recording can be.  The only two "names" in this recording who are likely to be remembered today are Beniamino Gigli and Licia Albanese, and both certainly display the qualities that made them famous. Giglis youthful, glowing tone perfectly embodies in aural terms the poets character, while Albaneses delicately shimmering and mature-sounding voice (she was, in fact, considerably younger than Gigli) makes Mimi both the shy charmer and slightly more worldly woman we come to know later in the opera. It helps tremendously that these two really give themselves over to the characters and really listen to each other. Their scene in act one is a miracle of tone color and word-pointing, so that the listener feels as though he or she is hearing this music for the first time. Later, in act three, the drama darkens, and Gigli and Albanese do as well, keeping cheap sentiment at a minimum but character and drama at the forefront. Gigli does allow himself to join Albanese for the top C at the close of the first act, but with such a cherishable singer, it is a liberty that can be overlooked. The rest of the cast are equally adept at bringing the text to life and creating their characters as if for the first time, providing ample and excellent support to their two star colleagues. Afro Poli as Marcello starts the opera off nicely and allows the brutish and suave sides of his character to coexist nicely, whereas most modern-day interepreters of the part tend to choose one or the other. His tone is full and blooming, turning coarse only under pressure. Tatiana Menotti fields an apt instrument for Musetta, without the shrillness or wiriness common to Musettas of the period. She colors her voice with a touch of acidity in the right places, such as the shoe episode in the second act or the quartet in the third. The rest of the cast is equally fine, balancing beautifully the light and shade within this opera. It cannot be mere coinicidence that a recording this good was made at La Scala by an all-Italian cast, orchestra, chorus, and conductor. Umberto Berrettoni leads his forces surprisingly well, considering the opera had to be recorded in 4-5 minute takes so as to fit on 78 sides. Only a few spots are rushed or indelicately handled. In summary, this 1938 recording is one of the glories of the pre-LP years. Unless you are completely allergic to the sound of vintage recordings, I urge you to hear this "Boheme" and experience for yourself this revelatory performance.      ',nonspam

That can be a handicap when coming to a work such as "Carmelites." Perhaps I am a bit better equipped to judge, as this is one of my favourite operas of all time.  This is a truly excellent performance, recorded in 1999 at the Opera National du Rhin. Aside from a small spoken scene in Act Three where Blanche learns of the arrest of the sisters, the performance is complete. The cast is uniformly excellent, but particular mention must be made of Anne-Sophie Schmidts highly moving Blanche and Nadine Denizes haunting old Prioress with a riveting death scene. Additionally, Patricia Petibon is a charming Constance and Hedwig Fassbender a sympathetic Mere Marie. The sets and costumes are simple and evocative without getting in the way of the action, and although Id quibble with the staging of the final climactic scene, everything else that is done is done extremely well. In short, if you want a DVD version of "Dialogues of the Carmelites," I really cant see this fine edition being bettered anytime soon.      ',spam

Beverly Sills version comes close to perfection, and we have stylish and excellent entries from Ileana Cotrubas and Angela Gheorghiu as well.

Everyone sings stylishly and with great attention to words and drama.  Michel Dens is a swaggering, virile Lescaut with a handsome baritone which displays a little thinness only on top.  Henri Legay is a true French tenor, lightweight and heady, with style to spare.  He opens "Ah, fuyez douce image" with a beautifully supported pianissimo and builds his phrases nicely, never straining or blasting. The real star of the show, however, is Madame de los Angeles.  She is a natural charmer, and this role fits her like a glove.  She cannot give us the high coloratura options that Sills does, but she does have a warmer, fuller tone.  Her delivery is less self-conscious and artificial than lesser Manons, and she never stoops to trying to sound coy or girlish in Act One.  Instead, she sings naturally, with that delicious smile in the voice, and we as her listeners are bewitched.  This is a Manon one always can sympathize with, even in her petulant and self-absorbed moments. Monteaux conducts with energy and vigor, although the traditional stage cuts are observed.  The sound is excellent mono, clear and full, never boxy like some of the early Callas recordings.  The spoken sections have a tendency to sound "tracked in," which they most likely were, at a later date. Which is the best "Manon?"  It really is a toss up between this and the Sills recording.  Depending on how my mood strikes me, I might choose one over the other, but it is a tough call.  If you have a preference for Sills or De Los Angeles, let that be your guide.  Otherwise, if your budget allows, I truly recommend you have both recordings in your collection.  They are masterpieces.      ',spam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	B00004XQ8L	January 17, 2001	8	8	4.0	Fascinating historical document	 This recording was made just about a year before Solti and producer John Culshaw started on their now-legendary "Ring" recording for Decca.  On this album, which might easily be regarded as a testing ground for the later project, the formidable Kirsten Flagstad takes the role of Brunnhilde. Flagstad was in her early 60s when this recording was made, but aside from a few slightly hollow-sounding notes, youd never know it.  Nobody could sing Wagner like this woman, and believe me, she really does SING this music.  No shrieking, belting, or bellowing for Madame Flagstad -- just pure, rich, dark, tone: this is what Wagner singing is all about. Otto Edelman is disappointing here.  He simply doesnt have the vocal heft or dark beauty of tone one expects from Wotan.  He is always intelligent and musical, but there are better recorded Wotans. Marianne Schech may not have the loveliest voice, but she is dramatically alive here in her brief contribution as Sieglinde. One or two voices aside, the Valkyries are a strong group, and I must single out Claire Watsons Helmwige for her fabulously secure singing of the opening "Ho-jo-to-ho" -- she doesnt scoop up to those perilous Bs and Cs but attacks them assuredly and fearlessly. Solti conducts well, if pressing a bit at times, and the Vienna Philharmonic plays beautifully.  The sound is excellent, bright and detailed, typical of Deccas high standard.  Notes on the recording are included, as well as a complete text.   This is a valuable issue for those who want to hear the legendary Flagstad in one of her signature roles in excellent stereo sound.      ',nonspam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	B0000016PU	January 10, 2001	10	10	4.0	Not the best, but quite good	 Perhaps no task is as daunting to the classical music novice as choosing a recording of Handels "Messiah."  It is a given that no one recording will satisfy all points equally well, although some come close.  Suzukis recording with the Bach Collegium Japan will probably not be any listeners first choice, but there are enough good things here to recommend this set. The recording is a period performance, and one on a smaller-scale than most: 21 choristers, 20 orchestral players.  It is a credit to Suzuki and his ensemble that the music nevers sounds thin or emaciated -- rather, there is a beautiful, delicate, other-worldly transparency that results.  This is one of the rare recordings that really makes "Messiah" a spiritual experience rather than an excuse to cash in on the familiarity of the music. The choir sings beautifully, always clean and with really jaw-droppingly accurate runs.  Listen to the "we have turned" melismas in "All we like sheep" and youll know what I mean.  The orchestra is equally fine; they can produce a full dramatic sound when necessary, but clarity and taste are always present. The soloists are a mixed bag.  Im disappointed in the men -- John Elwes has some truly bizarre pronunciation issues and it feels like hes attacking the text rather than enunciating it.  David Thomas sounds worn and dry, and his coloratura is approximate, with some notes only guessed at. However, the higher-voiced soloists are from another plane entirely -- they sound angelic, unearthly.  Both have soft-grained voices with just enough vibrato to add interest.  Neither would be my first choice to hear in this music, but they fit Suzukis concept of the score brilliantly.  Each has coloratura that rises naturally out of the line and becomes part of the line itself, rather than just an excuse for technical display -- Ive never heard these passages sung like this in any other "Messiah" recording.  It reminds the listener that coloratura was a normal part of Baroque vocal expression and should be treated as such.  Tasteful vocal ornamentation is allowed, as well, which I like.  The pronunciation of Mr. Mera and Ms. Suzuki is also excellent -- an occasional odd vowel sound aside, youd never guess that these werent native English speakers. This is a recording that reminds us how special this music is and how easy (and dangerous) it can be to become accustomed to bland, mechanical performances of this masterpiece.  The tenor and bass soloists aside, this is a fine recording -- not a first choice, perhaps, but one recommended to augment a personal favorite.      ',nonspam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	B000050HZZ	November 15, 2000	5	5	5.0	Utterly beguiling	 We are lucky to have this recording back in the catalogue after a much-too-long absence.   In fact, as far as I can tell, this is its first release on CD. Many listeners will have fond memories of having been in or seen a production of this show at an early age and will treasure reliving those memories through this CD.  For those who dont know anything about the show, I recommend highly that you set cynicism aside for an hour and give into the delights in store. "Youre a Good Man, Charlie Brown" came out of a decade when off-Broadway shows were in their prime. "The Fantasticks," "Little Mary Sunshine," "Godspell," "Dames at Sea,"; all these shows used their small budgets and limited resources as assets, counter-acting the overblown, bloated, lavish Broadway productions.  These shows had at their center a sense of fun and, most importantly, heart, which drew audiences to them in droves. "Youre a Good Man" captures not only the fun of the "Peanuts" characters but the essence and spirit of the wonderful comic as well.  The actors are simple and direct, never falling into the coy archness some adults adopt when playing young children.  The show itself is sweet without being syrupy and the music is pure fun and joy. I wont compare this recording with the new Broadway cast; I like both of them, and dont wish to denigrate either of them.  Both are valid ways of performing this show, although very different.  The new cast is more polished and is backed by a more varied instrumental group, while the original cast plays the piece more sincerely, at a less cartoonish level.  Again, I like both versions and recommend having both in your collection, but if you only want one, decide which is more important to you: polish and sparkle, or simplicity and charm. This disc is a great memento of one of the most beloved off-Broadway shows ever written; many thanks to Decca for bringing it back to us!      ',spam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	B00002VW6C	November 3, 2000	30	31	4.0	Excellent overall	 Although Id quibble with some muddying of the facts, this film presents an excellent overview of the events leading up to the Jonestown tragedy of 1978.   The film starts with Jones as a child involved in preaching the gospel to anyone who will listen.  The more disturbing aspects of Jones childhood (including his torture and killing of small animals) are left unexplored.  However, as the film progresses, we do get more of an idea of the sickness of the Reverend Jim Jones.  His drug use, seduction of both male and female parishioners, staged "healings," questionable financial dealings, and vicious public castigation of Temple Members are all given due screen time. The cast is unbelievable for a TV movie -- Powers Boothe riveting as Jones, Veronica Cartwright excellent as his wife Marceline, as well as James Earl Jones, Colleen Dewhurst, Diane Ladd, Brad Dourif, Ned Beatty, LeVar Burton, Meg Foster, Randy Quaid, Brenda Vaccaro, and many others.   Despite the films grainy picture quality, the production values are admirably high as well -- the recreation of Jonestown is frighteningly eerie, and the film features a great score by the always excellent Elmer Bernstein. Some may not like the compression of facts and events.  Names are changed and characters are switched around. For instance, Tim and Grace Stoen (they are given different names in the film) were not shot at the airstrip in Port Kaituma, nor did Congressman Ryan spend the night at the Jonestown compound.  There are also several key players who seem to be missing in the film: Deborah and Larry Layton, and Caroline and Annie Moore, for instance.   However, the final suicide scene is absolutely harrowing.  The dialogue is taken from the actual tape recording made at the suicide, and the director wisely chose to shoot the scene without any music.  This gives it the feel of a documentary, and it is easily worth watching the entire movie just for this finale.  I cannot imagine anyone being able to watch this scene without tears in their eyes. Despite its rather free treatment of the facts surrounding the demise of the Peoples Temple, this film contains excellent performances and should be seen by anyone with an interest in this particular tragedy or cults in general.

' A104KYSJJZLWB4	1578900115	September 29, 2000	18	18	3.0	A fine production marred by cuts	 The Brent-Walker series is currently the only complete (except for "Utopia, Limited" and "The Grand Duke") video set of Gilbert and Sullivan operas available.  And, as far as I can tell, this is the only version of "Yeomen of the Guard" available on video in the U. S. This is the "serious" Gilbert and Sullivan, the closest thing to a grand opera the pair would ever do.  If, like me, you have viewed the entire Brent-Walker series, youll know that this production relies less on cutesy camera tricks and more on characterization and a real sense of the operas purpose.  The costumes and sets are really lovely, and the acting is very good, considering that many of the cast are singers before they are actors.  Particular mention must be made of Alfred Marks as a likable Wilfred and Elizabeth Gale as a sympathetic Elsie (which is no mean feat; I consider Elsie the least sympathetic herione in the G & S canon). Pride of place, however, must go to Joel Greys Jack Point, a stunning portrayal.  I know there are those who disagree with me (I read one review that called him "dull as dishwater") but I find Grey a wonderful Point.  He shouldnt be, of course -- he plays the part with an American accent and is a high tenor rather than the baritone the role calls for.  However, the accent helps to mark Point as an outsider, and Grey has no problem with the lower end of his range.  He really plays the role with a sense of the bitterness underneath the jesters facade, without alienating the affection of the audience.  Jack Point is the pivotal part in this piece; depending on how the actor chooses to portray him, "Yeomen" can end up being a light operetta or a dark opera.  Here, it is most decidedly the latter. Grey is especially moving in the final scene as well -- if he doesnt break your heart, you really must be a cynic. My review has been positive thus far, so why only three stars?  Alas, the video is marred by the excision of no fewer than six entire numbers, as well as the opening verse of Phoebes spinning song.  Some of the most famous songs are gone -- both of Fairfaxs arias as well as the quartets "When a Wooer goes a-wooing" and "Strange adventure."  The decision for the elimination of these numbers is inexplicable.  Apparently some of them were filmed and shown on the BBC broadcast, but no video version contains them.  There is missing dialogue as well, most notably the scene between Elsie and the disguised Fairfax and the scene when Dame Carruthers discovers Sergeant Merylls secret.  Presumably these cuts were made so that the piece would fit into the two-hour time slot alotted to the other videos, but if so, that is a poor reason. So enjoy this video for what is there: costumes, sets, performances (especially Grey), but make sure you have a good recording handy so you dont have to do without the missing music.      ',nonspam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	6304697996	August 23, 2000	8	8	4.0	Pure, unadulterated cheese!	 Ah, Jamie Lee, queen of the horror fans heart.  In this goofy entry in the dead teen/slasher subgenre, every possible cliche is played to the  hilt, with the results being both hilarious and quite endearing.  We get  references from "Carrie" and "Halloween" as well as  countless other stock situations.   Jamie Lee plays the ubiquitous  "final girl," although in this film we learn early on that she is  in no danger from the killer. Those students who ARE being stalked on the  night of "Disco Madness" run the gamut of stereotypes for this  kind of film: the bitch, the party girl, Mr. popularity, the virgin, the  greaser.  They are dispatched in typical stalk n slash fashion, but the  gore content is pretty tame (although some viewers may be disappointed by  this).  The soundtrack is a real hoot, with disco songs that sound eerily  familiar to popular hits of the day -- youll be able to spot a couple of  BeeGees knockoffs and an inane "I Will Survive" clone, among  others.  Best of all is Jamie Lee strutting her stuff in a pointless disco  extravaganza.  It may not add anything to the movie, but the kitsch level  is increased tenfold! Despite its derivative nature and its piecemeal  construction, "Prom Night" is a cheese-filled indulgence for  those who get a kick out of slasher movies.  Strange as it may seem for a  horror film, it has an innocence and a slight tongue-in-cheek quality that  make it highly entertaining.  If you have a sense of humor and an hour and  a half to kill on a rainy afternoon, check out "Prom Night."  It  may not be great cinema, but it is a heck of a lot of fun.      ',nonspam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	6305841985	August 23, 2000	7	9	4.0	"I thought you were the killah!"	 Yes, heavy New York accents are just one of the many delights to look forward to in this little gem of a B-movie.  What might be seen on the  surface as a standard teens-at-camp stalk n slash fest is elevated to the  level of pure camp (in all senses of the word) ecstasy through the use of  some truly bizarre plot devices and themes. First, mention must be made  of the overt gay themes and homoeroticism in the movie, unheard of in most  films in this genre.  Young Angela and her brother Peter are being raised  by a gay couple, while activities at the camp are pervaded over by  thickly-muscled Italian jocks wearing short-shorts and midriff T-shirts.   There is also a gratuitous all-male skinny-dipping scene.  Even stranger is  the fact that director Robert Hiltzik is, apparently, straight. Now throw  into the mix some acting that is either outright bad or sublimely hammy and  scenery-chewing.  Loony Aunt Martha and the venomous Judy (who wears a  T-shirt bearing her name, in case you forget who she is) give the ultimate  in over-the-top characterizations which end up being loads of fun.  The  three youngest actors (Jonathan Tiersten, Felissa Rose, and Christopher  Collet) give the most natural and convincing performances. Then add some  clever murder sequences (Judys nasty demise being one of my all-time  favorites) which fulfill the gore requirement without resorting to buckets  of blood.  In fact, I think only one death scene contains any significant  amout of blood. Now, for the piece de resistance, give the film one of  the most jaw-dropping endings in horror cinema.  Another, more famous film  used the same idea ten years later, but lets remember that "Sleepaway  Camp" was there first (Once you see the scene, youll know exactly  which other film Im talking about).  Youve got to give everyone involved  in this movie credit for having the guts to give the film an ending like  this. One word of caution: if you are not a fan of slasher pics or  grade-B cult classics, you will not like this picture.  If, however, you  have a real affinity for the genre and a true affection for the  considerable charms of low-budget, campy horror films and have not yet seen  "Sleepaway Camp," give yourself a real treat and get this  movie. (A Note: the DVD contains a commentary track by director Hiltzik  and star Felissa Rose, but it is maddeningly uninformative.  When asked how  a certain scene was shot or an effect was achieved, Hiltzik most often  simply states that it was "movie magic."  A disappointment for  those of us who were waiting for this DVD.)      ',nonspam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	B000000SMI	July 18, 2000	4	4	5.0	Excellent sampling of Bachs vocal music	 These recordings are taken mostly from the Harnoncourt/Leonhardt complete sacred Bach cantatas project, with several selections from the Saint Matthew Passion included as well.  While I generally prefer womens voices  to boys in this repertoire (not authentic, I know), this CD makes an  excellent case for using boys voices in this music.  The young soloists  are all remarkably assured and sing with lovely, full tone, much different  from the sound of English choirboys (most of the soloists here are German,  Austrian, or Dutch).  There are particularly lovely accounts of "Mein  glaubiges Herze," "Blute nur," and "Flosst, mein  Heiland" included here.  So if you are looking to sample Bachs vocal  works, or wish to hear the pure sound of boy sopranos, or simply want some  lovely music, this is a disc to try.      ',spam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	B000006E4B	July 15, 2000	10	10	5.0	Spellbinding	 I have lived with this disc for nearly two years now and am still blown away by it.  It is simply breathtaking.   For those unaware, Sanford Sylvan is an American baritone best known for roles in John Adams operas  "Nixon in China" and "The Death of Klinghoffer."  But  where Sylvan really excels is in the world of the art song.  These three  song cycles showcase his considerable interpretive talents.  He has a truly  lovely lyric voice full of expressive capabilities and myriad colors, and  he knows how to use the text intelligently without becoming blatant or  arch. The first song cycle, by Theodore Chanler, is a little-known gem  consisting of epitaphs by Walter de la Mare.  Each selection is so simple  and direct that one can easily imagine oneself reading these epitaphs  carved on tombstones in a New England cemetary.  The simplicity is so  affecting and Sylvans performance so understated that after the cycle has  ended the listener feels emotionally drained. The two more famous  selections are Barbers Hermit Songs and Coplands Emily Dickinson poems.   The Barber interpretations rank with the best, if not perhaps topping any  of them (Eleanor Stebers comes readily to mind).  The Copland, on the  other hand, is my favorite rendition of these pieces ever.  This is a  personal preference, for normally these songs are sung by a woman.  But to  hear Sylvan, an openly gay man, sing "Heart, we will forget him,"  is an experience not to be missed for its added dimension of loss and  loneliness. Not to slight the accompanists contribution, Mr. Breitman  plays exceptionally well, coloring the piano tone almost as expertly as  Sylvan does his voice.  These two make up an extraordinarily attuned  duo. Do yourself a favor and pick up this disc -- I guarantee you a  listening experience you wont soon forget.      ',spam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	B000024XAK	July 15, 2000	11	11	5.0	Simply Glorious	 It seems that a decent baritone can be found nearly anywhere nowadays, but a truly magnificent one is a rare phenomenon.  Thats why it is such a joy to discover this disc of Matthias Goerne singing three of Bachs solo  cantatas for bass.  Simply put, this is the best recording of these  cantatas that I have ever heard. Mr. Goerne combines a really beautiful  voice (his opening phrase in "Ich habe genug" will make your  heart stop) with intelligent, subtle word-pointing (not suprising, being a  student of both Fischer-Dieskau and Schwarzkopf).  His singing is both  poignantly human and reverently spiritual, exactly right for this music,  which is some of Bachs finest. Sir Roger Norrington conducts with an  unerring sense of line and phrasing, and Camerata Academica Salzburg play  with a warmth and transparency that is wholly engaging.  Special mention  must be made of oboist Albrecht Mayers haunting solo lines in BWV 82, the  best Ive heard them played. If you are unfamiliar with Mr. Goerne, I  strongly urge you to hear this disc for yourself and succumb to the  artistry of one of the finest young baritones in classical music today.      ',spam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	B0000007D4	June 25, 2000	11	11	3.0	Scholarly but ultimately uninspiring	 Nicholas McGegan has conducted some excellent Handel recordings in the past and is something of a specialist in this repertoire. However, his recording of "Messiah" leaves something to be desired.  There is  a lack of feeling that pervades the entire piece -- everyone does a  thoroughly professional job, but it ends up sounding like just that: a JOB.     Its really a pity, because McGegan goes further in his scholarship  than do other conductors by including nearly all the variants which Handel  wrote through the years for different performances of the oratorio.  So we  get not only the 4/4 version of "Rejoice greatly" but the lilting  12/8 version as well (which I prefer).  There are four versions of  "But who may abide" and "How beautiful are the feet of  them," three of "Thou art gone up on high" and a soprano  version of "He was despised."  The list goes on. The  performance itself, however, simply cannot compete with other recordings.   The choir has a light, pleasant sound but is placed too far back, and the  sound as recorded is boxy with very little "air" around the  voices.  All the soloists are capable and unoffensive, but uninspired as  well.  Only Lorraine Hunt really comes to life singing the alternate  soprano version of "He was despised," giving a reading both  luminous and heart-breaking. If you are looking for a really fine  period-instrument recording, I can recommend three: John Eliot Gardiners,  Trevor Pinnocks (with superb soloists in Arleen Auger and Anne Sofie von  Otter) and Paul McCreeshs more recent version with one of the strongest  line-ups of soloists Ive heard in a long time.  Also worth looking into is  Richard Westenbergs recording with Musica Sacra, easy to overlook.  It  contains the 12/8 version of "Rejoice" and the soprano/alto duet  version of "How beautiful are the feet" and the following chorus,  "Break forth into joy."  The soprano soloist is the marvelous  Judith Blegen, one of the best.  Compared to these four recordings,  McGegans is an also-ran.  Buy it for the scholarship and the extra music,  but get another version to hear an actual performance of  "Messiah."      ',nonspam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	B00002DDVR	June 2, 2000	8	11	5.0	Dramatically vivid version of Mozart masterpiece	 William Christie and Les Arts Florissants have amassed an impressive body of recorded work, and this disc of Mozarts C Minor Mass is one more feather in their collective cap.  Christie conducts a rather fast  performance, yet he finds the humanity in this music and never treats it  with kid gloves, as some period performances make the mistake of doing.   (Who said one has to take the guts out of Mozart to make it authentic?)   Christies Mozart is both passionate and committed, making this a  rewarding, moving, and involving listening experience.   It helps that  Christie has excellent soloists at his disposal, particularly in the two  prominent soprano parts.  Here we actually get a second soprano instead of  a mezzo, and the music benefits from the sound of two well-contrasted  soprano timbres.  That second soprano is the excellent Lynne Dawson, who  sings "Laudamus te" with clean attack and full, rich tone.  Even  better is the relative newcomer, Patricia Petibon, who can cope with the  extreme low notes in the "Kyrie" (one of the few recordings in  which those notes are truly audible) or the high, ethereal line in "Et  incarnatus est" without losing her sweetness and purity of tone.  That  last aria is taken a touch too fast for my liking, but Petibons  performance is so lovely that I can easily set aside my  reservations. While this may not be the best performance of Mozarts C  Minor Mass, it certainly places high against the recorded competition.  For  a refreshing view of a much-loved work, try this recording.

' A104KYSJJZLWB4	B00004NK26	May 13, 2000	29	40	5.0	A recording to cherish	 The operas of Handel are surely an acquired taste, the opera seria format seeming stiff and contrived to modern listeners.  But if you develop an apetite for them, you may just find yourself becoming addicted.  This new  recording of "Alcina" could be just the ticket to start newcomers  on the road toward falling in love with Handelian opera. This is not the  first complete recording of "Alcina." Two others, with Joan  Sutherland and Arleen Auger in the title role, exist but are currently  unavailable in the United States.  However, this recording excels in making  the characters human, the situations moving and valid, and the emotions  palpable.   The first glory of the set is undoubtedly the singing of  Renee Fleming in the title role.  Her voice improves on her recorded  predecessors by not only being exceptionally beautiful but irresistably  sensuous as well.  Her singing of Handel is a revelation, when her first  aria is launched with a voice of fullness, warmth and creamy tone.  This is  no standard "period" soprano a la Emma  Kirkby, but a real woman:  Fleming believes in this character and her emotions, and makes her  sympathetic to us.  Her complete dramatic involvement make Alcina a living,  breathing being, rather than a posturing cardboard nightingale. Susan  Graham is equally effective as Ruggiero, her voice as warm and beautiful as  Flemings.  She may lack the full dramatic commitment to the character that  Fleming has, but then Ruggiero is not as developed as Alcina.  She does,  however, contribute an exquisitely shaded and nuanced version of  "Verdi prati." Natalie Dessays frequent excursions into the  altissimo range may bother some purists (she caps "Tornami a  vagheggiar" with a high F), but for my money her embellishments are  right on for the flighty character of Morgana.  Her voice remains sweet,  clear, and slightly reedy, contrasting well with the other sopranos in the  cast. The rest of the cast is good, if without the degree of commitment  and polish exhibited by the three leading ladies.  Kathleen Kuhlmann  repeats her Bradamante from the Auger set, sounding firm if rather  unyielding in tone and with aspirated coloratura.  Juanita Lascarro is  light and pure as the child Oberto, although it would have been nice to  have a boy soprano sing the part, as it was done in Handels time.  The men  are also good, if unexceptionable.  The chorus sings well but is difficult  to understand. William Christie shapes the performance beautifully; this  may be his best work to date.  Les Arts Florissants plays with energy and  crisp ensemble, embellishing the da capos right along with the  singers. For those wary of live recordings, fear not.  A few odd sonic  balances aside, the sound is excellent, arias better than the recitatives.   Applause comes at the end of each act, so the flow remains uniterrupted  within the piece. I wouldnt want to be without the two earlier  recordings of "Alcina," but for an experience that makes the work  vital and exciting, as well as a near-perfect reading of the title role by  Renee Fleming, give this set a try.

' A104KYSJJZLWB4	B000009OR0	May 11, 2000	16	16	5.0	Wonderful singing, fully characterized	 French soprano Veronique Gens has made something of a specialty of singing 18th century opera, including the works of Mozart.  But dont think that Gens is one in the line of asexual, vibrato-less, "period"  sopranos.  Her voice is warm, creamy, womanly, and full.  Her techincal  accomplishment is excellent, and while her coloratura never dazzles, it is  always propelled by dramatic impetus. In fact, it is Gens sense of drama  and attention to character, situation, and text, which sets this disc on a  higher level than that of other fine Mozart aria recitals.  Gens inhabits  each character, so that her Vitellia is mature, weary, and resigned, while  her Sesto is noble, impetuous, and highly earnest.  She differentiates  Cherubino from the Countess, Zerlina from Donna Elvira, while sounding  vocally "right" for each.  Listen to Sestos "Deh, per  queste istante" and then the following "Batti, batti," and  see if you dont for a moment wonder if two different singers recorded the  arias. For those already familiar with the work of Mme. Gens, this  recital is self-recommending.  For those who have yet to discover her  artistry, I urge you to purchase this recording and succumb to the  considerable charms of one of the finest Mozart sopranos singing today.      ',spam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	B000026ADX	February 23, 2000	23	23	5.0	Treasurable Donizetti Rarity	 The folks at Opera Rara must have done some real digging to present this one to us.  Donizettis fifth opera, and his first success, was presented in mutilated form in 1822, when one of the tenors died before the first  performance.  His role was given to a mezzo, with much cutting and  reshaping of vocal lines.  In 1824, the opera was revived, this time with  newly composed pieces for a mezzo hero.  This unusual performance history  is told in detail in the excellent notes that accompany this set. The  performance is excellent as well.  Opera Raras first sets in the late  1970s often featured adequate but not stellar performers.  Happily, in the  past decade they have been able to feature world-class, if not  world-famous, talent.  Tops among the performers must be the always  excellent Bruce Ford, whose full tone coupled with excellent florid  technique makes him one of, if not THE finest tenor working in this  repertoire today.  Paul Austin Kelly is nearly as fine, with a lighter tone  that contrasts well with Ford. Newcomer Majella Cullagh makes a highly  favourable impression as the title character.  She has a bright, gem-like  soprano which remains full and ample, and is capable of great expressivity.   Her coloratura is as fleet and fine as her colleagues.  She is one to  watch for in coming years. In addition to providing the complete 1822  version originally written for two tenors, this set includes the 1824  revisions in an appendix, in which one of the tenor roles is sung by a  mezzo.  Happily, that assignment is given to Diana Montague, who easily  matches the high standard set by the rest of the cast. As for the quality  of the music, it is remarkably assured for a young composer and really  quite enjoyable.  The influence of Mayr, Donizettis teacher, is to be  found throughout.  There are many excellent pieces, not the least of which  are the first act quartet, Zoraidas aria "Rose che un di  spiegaste" and a duet for Ford and Montague in the revised  version. David Parry conducts well, and the Academy of St.  Martin-in-the-Fields plays beautifully.  If you enjoy bel canto operas and  are looking for something rare and unique, give this recording a try.      ',nonspam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	B00000K4FQ	February 16, 2000	11	11	5.0	High quality and captivating characterizations	 While it may be cliche, the old maxim rings true here: they just dont make them like this anymore.  True, this set has its drawbacks, but a performance like this makes any such quibbles easy to forget. Firstly,  mention must be made of the exceptional cast assembled here: virtually  everyone is excellent.  Pride of place must go to Elisabeth Grummers  excellent Hansel.  While this is a part normally assumed by mezzos,  Grummers lovely soprano has enough weight in the lower range to present no  problems with the low tessitura.  The higher-lying passages are,  predictably, no problem for her.  Her voice remains radiantly beautiful  throughout, and her characterization is sweetly boyish without being  cloying (a trap many interpreters of these roles fall into). Elisabeth  Schwarzkopf is a singer whose recordings continue to fascinate decades  after they were made.  Casting her as Gretel is an unusual choice (she  normally took on slightly weightier roles -- she and Grummer, in fact, sang  many of the same parts) and while she has to work to sound childlike, her  way with the text is unmatched by any recorded Gretel.  Her minx-like  teasing of Hansel or her gauzy wonder at the appearance of the gingerbread  house are just two notable examples.  She also sings her Act 2 opening solo  with a hushed innocence: for once, Gretel actually sounds like shes  singing a folk tune to herself. The rest of the cast is quite good, if  without the obvious excellence of the two leads.  Else Schurhoffs Witch is  fine; she really sounds like an old crone, but manages to sound  frighteningly imposing when casting her spell.  Maria von Ilsovay and Josef  Metternich are both good, and Anny Felbermayers soft-grained, childlike  tone is right-on for her otherworldly assignments.  She is marginally  better as the Dew Fairy.  What really sets the entire cast apart, however,  is their scrupulous attention to the text and the interplay between  characters.  Everyone seems to be listening to each other, and that  concentration and involvement really shines through. The sound,  particularly in this remastered version, is excellent: not a digital sonic  spectacular, true, but youll probably forget youre listening to a mono  recording. Im not crazy about Herbert von Karajans conducting in this  piece.  The loftier sections are really wonderful, but the lighter moments  lack the propulsion and fleetness to really sweep us along (the awakening  scene seemed interminable here).   For the best recording of Hansel and  Gretel, Id recommend the Kurt Eichorn recording with Helen Donath and Anna  Moffo.  It also contains the best Sandman, Dew Fairy, and Witch (Christa  Ludwig) on records.  But if you have room for another classic recording,  dont pass this one up.      ',spam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	6303626416	February 14, 2000	14	14	5.0	Great silent adaptation of Dickens classic	 This version of "Oliver Twist" is a scant 74 minutes long, but contains much more of the book (including a portion of the Rose Maylie sequence) and retains a highly Dickensian flavor when viewed alongside other adaptations. If you are new to silent films, this could be a good  one to whet your appetite.  If you are already a fan, give this one a try.   The film is primarily a vehicle for Jackie Coogan, which proves to be just  fine, as he is delightful in the title role.  His expressive face and tiny  stature are dead-right for Oliver, and he has more spunk than most  exponents of the role, which helps to allay the saccharine nature of the  character. Fans of Lon Chaney may be disappointed with the little screen  time he is given, but he makes the most of it.  Subtle touches Chaney adds  (such as gently laying a hand on Bill Sikes chest) give a wealth of  subtext and nuance to his performance, and adds immeasurably to our  understanding of Fagin as petty thief.   The rest  of the cast is good, with a fine performance from Gladys Brockwell as  Nancy.  She is another aspect of the film which rings true to Dickens: she  is less the "hooker with a heart of gold" than a complex,  hardened woman who has grown up among criminals yet retains her  conscience. Mention must also be made of the fine production design.   Many scenes look as though they were lifted from the original Cruikshank  illustrations (especially the meeting at London Bridge) and the men look  particularly appropriate for the period.  Some of the women retain the 20s  look in makeup and hair, which is typical of Hollywood period movies  through the 1970s. The title cards also are well-done, either quoting  directly from Dickens or retaining his authorial flavor. All told, this  is a winning adaptation of a perennial favorite.      ',spam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	B000002524	February 5, 2000	12	15	3.0	Well, she tried . . .	 Barbra Streisand, like many other artists, went through an "experimental" phase, trying to expand boundaries and broaden the apparent limits of what she could do.  Some of it, like her forays into  contemporary music, worked beautifully.  Others, like this odd  "concept" TV special, seemed to be early signs of the Streisand  ego getting in the way of her music-making.   The title says it all;  those "other musical instruments" are chosen from around the  globe and sprinkled in various numbers to add an international flavor.  It  works in some ways, but mostly sounds clumsy and poorly thought out. Babs  also tries to push the boundaries by using electronic instruments (which to  modern ears sound delightfully absurd) and "found" instruments,  such as kitchen appliances.  Judge for yourself, but for my taste, the  results are nearly unlistenable. However, I still dont want to be  without this album, because it contains two really marvelous cuts, with  Barbra doing what she does best: getting to the heart of a song and giving  it everything shes got.  "I Never Has Seen Snow" and "The  Sweetest Sounds" will be familiar to Broadway buffs (they were both  originally sung by Diahann Caroll, although for different shows) and are  fine ballads, given top-notch performances here (although how "I Never  Has Seen Snow" fits the concept is something Im not clear on). I  must also register a pet peeve: although I love her, Babs has no business  singing "Auf dem Wasser zu singen," and certainly not giving it  the cloying, condescending treatment she does here.  And why the  pseudo-baroque instrumentation?  The song was written in 1823, for Petes  sake!  Try Elly Ameling or the late Arleen Auger to hear how Schubert  should be sung. In summary, a failed experimental album, but  indispensable for two prime Streisand cuts.      ',nonspam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	0767019954	January 27, 2000	67	67	5.0	Excellent adaptation of Thackeray masterpiece	 Thackerays "Vanity Fair" is such a sprawling, grand example of the Victorian novel that any mere two-hour movie adaptation will be forced to leave out crucial elements.  As it is, this six-hour BBC film version  emits certain items (Jos Sedleys ultimate fate, the James Crawley  episode), but is remarkably faithful to its source.  Indeed, a television  mini-series is the best way to adapt such a work, allowing the story to  unfold and the viewer to become involved with the various  characters. This production is fantastic, with beautiful costumes,  excellent performances, and a fine script.  Chief among its attractions is  Natasha Little in the key role of Becky Sharp.  Miss Little is not only  luminously beautiful, but manages to arouse our sympathies toward a  virtually unsympathetic character.  Special mention must also go to Jeremy  Swift, whose portrayal of bumbling Jos Sedley is a delight.  Miriam  Margolyes (always wonderful) and Eleanor Bron appear in secondary roles.   The rest of the cast is well-chosen and all play their parts with  conviction. The greatest hurdle a filmed version of "Vanity  Fair" faces is how to convey the many shifts of tone which Thackeray  goes through in the novel.  This problem has been solved by use of an  unusual score, which draws from such diverse sources as military marching  bands, Strauss waltzes (wrong for the period but who cares?), and a bit of  Kurt Weill.  Murray Golds score never lets us forget that we are in the  world of Thackerays biting satire, and not Jane Austens more delicate  world of comedy-of-manners. All told, it will take a long time before  this film treatment is bettered.      ',spam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	B000009CXF	December 29, 1999	14	14	5.0	Wonderfully diverting	 What a pleasant surprise this disc was!  Realizing that I had no copy of the "Anna Magdalena Notebook" in my collection, I browsed around until I selected this particular recording, mainly because of the number of  selections it offered.  I had not heard of any of the performers before,  but am glad I took the chance. Karina Gauvin sings the arias with a full,  flutey timbre, eschewing the "white" sound favored by many  sopranos in this repertoire.  Her account of the lovely "Bist du bei  mir" is particularly good: exalted, grave, and ethereal all at once.   There were times when she struck me as sounding remarkably akin to the late  Arleen Auger, and that can only be to the good.  I really hope to hear more  from her. Luc Beausejour plays with a delicacy and refinement that are  most welcome, and embellishes tastefully.  The simplicity of many of the  selections bring playing that is clear and alive; Beausejour fills these  old chestnuts with charm and individuality.  The recording engineers have  done a superb job in making the harpsichord sound full and rich -- too  often, the harpsichord can sound tinny, even abrasive on recordings. I  heartily recommend this disc.      ',spam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	B0000023MB	December 29, 1999	11	12	5.0	Glorious voice, troubling past	 Have you ever eaten something truly delicious, or had a good wine, only to find later that it left an unpleasant aftertaste in your mouth?  Perhaps the next time you were offered the offending item you thought twice:  "Should I indulge and regret it later, or should avoid it  altogether?" Forgive this tangent, but listening to the voice of  Tiana Lemnitz is an experience similar to the one I described above.  The  voice itself is ravishing, but the knowledge of Lemnitzs Nazi associations  (ardent support, really) becomes analogous to the unpleasant aftertaste and  almost ruins the experience. I know aestheticians say that an artists  personal life should have no bearing on whether their work is of a high  quality or not, and for that reason I give this particular disc five stars.   For the voice itself is exquisite, and the technical expertise assured.   Lemnitz falls into that category of German soprano who sings with creamy  tone, unfailing musicality, and an almost ethereal purity (think Janowitz,  Della Casa, or Gruemmer) and who makes a marvelous Agathe, Elsa, and Eva.   Lemnitzs pianissimo is on a par with Caballe -- indeed, it was her  specialty.  Her Mozart arias are breathtaking, her Wagner otherworldly, and  her "Freischuetz" arias masterfully sung.  Everything is marked  by a coolness and reserve (compare her Verdi to the passionate and  committed Italians Maria Caniglia or Gina Cigna), but the vocalism is  superb. This disc is an excellent introduction to the artistry of one of  the finest German sopranos of the inter-war years.  If one could only  ignore that aftertaste . . .      ',spam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	B0000041ZF	December 13, 1999	9	10	5.0	Excellent recording	 While this may not be the best "Magic Flute" (and the debate on that topic is too involved to get into), anyone looking for a good digital recording cant go wrong with this version. Soltis conducting hasnt  changed that much since his earlier recording.  That one may be marginally  better than this version, but it comes on three CDs compared to this later  recording which takes only two. The best thing about this recording is  Ruth Ziesaks lovely Pamina: pure, lovely tone, lighter than others  (Janowitz, Te Kanawa) but convincingly girlish rather than matronly.  One  of the best.  Kurt Moll is once again an excellent Sarastro, though maybe  lacking the final degree of authority found in his earlier recordings.   Kraus as Papageno sounds a bit fluttery at times, but he projects the  character well.   Uwe Heilmans Tamino is not as bad as some have said,  but he certainly is no Wunderlich (who is?).  However, he sings with  commitment and a sure sense of style.  While I prefer a dramatic coloratura  in the Queens music (a la Studer, Deutekom, or best of all, Edda Moser),  Sumi Jo has the pyrotechnical accomplishment to make her one of the finest  Queens on rcord.  The voice is round and bell-like, never shrill, and the  high staccati notes glitter.  However, she is even better on the Arnold  Oestman recording. The rest of the cast is fine, with special mention  going to Heinz Zedniks oily, sycophantic Monostatos.  Also worthy of note  are the three boys, who sing gorgeously, better than any other recording  which uses treble voices in the parts.  A fine version of "Flute"  for the first-time listener or to add alongside other recordings.      ',spam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	B00000JZ03	December 11, 1999	19	19	5.0	Fantastic	 EMI have raided their considerable vaults and come up with a collection that has been sorely needed.  Many of the singers on this disc are unrepresented in the current CD catalogue, so it is a real pleasure to have  them here at last. The sopranos chosen certainly fit the description  "In the Grand Tradition," although Id quibble with a couple of  choices (its hard to think of Alda Noni as "grand").  Each is  represented by one well-chosen aria, beginning with a 1926 recording by  Puccinis first Liu, Maria Zamboni, singing "Signore, ascolta."   It is too choked with sobs and overwrought, but what a piece of history!   Other highlights are a moving "Laltra notte" by Pia Tassinari  (who indulges in one disruptive sob at the end -- you cant accuse the  Italians of a lack of passion) and a lovely "Donde lieta" by Sara  Scuderi.  We also get an authoritative "When I am laid in earth"  by Kirsten Flagstad and a lush Mariettas Lied sung by Joan Hammond.  Best  of all, perhaps, is Eleanor Stebers rapturous rendition of "Depuis le  jour," one of the best recordings of that aria ever. Every track,  however, is highly enjoyable and unique.  These are singers that left their  indivual stamp on the music, from the lyric Toti dal Monte and Margherita  Carosio to the dramatic Gina Cigna and Maria Caniglia to the more famous  Sena Jurinac, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, and Leonie Rysanek.  Todays focus on  superb musicianship above all else has raised technical accomplishment but  has eliminated the individuality and overwhelming personality evident in  these early recordings.  For a glimpse into an older (but hopefully not  forgotten) tradition, this disc is invaluable.      ',spam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	B00000JYU6	December 9, 1999	9	9	5.0	Most Welcome	 This, the first complete recording of Glucks original Italian version of "Alceste," is an excellent achievement.   Before this recording, I knew only the primary arias from the French  "Alceste" recorded by Callas and Janet Baker.  Both of these  divas give an electrifying performance of "Divinites du Styx,"  the most familiar aria.  Here, titled "Ombre, larve," the aria is  simpler, less assured, and perhaps not as fully developed as the French  revision.  However, throughout the entire opera, the simplicity of line and  the musical distillation of emotion which Gluck sought is supremely  evident.  To compare this work to the opera seria of Handels time almost  forty years earlier is to realize the true extent of Glucks reforms. The  cast is, for the most part, excellent.  Teresa Ringholz brings a lovely,  rather soft-grained instrument to Alcestes music and sings with a firm  line and dramatic commitment, if perhaps without the fire of a Callas or  Baker.  A fuller chest register would be an asset in this music, but that  is a small point.  She is quite good and dominates this set as she should.   Justin Lavender here sounds a little unfocused and woolly, qualities I have  not heard in him before, so I am willing to chalk it up to a peculiarity in  the recorded sound.  Other than that, he makes a fine Admeto.  A couple of  unsteady minor roles aside, the rest of the cast is very good. Arnold  Oestman leads the Drottningholm Orchestra and Chorus with style and  excellent control.  Everything is well-paced and the recitatives are lively  and involving, never dull.  Despite this being a live performance, the  stage noises are almost nonexistant.  Naxos has provided an English  translation alongside the Italian libretto, and the cueing points are more  than generous.  While we are unlikely to have another recording of  "Alceste" (French or Italian) anytime soon, I cant see this set  being bettered.  Tremendous value and an excellent buy.  Dont miss it.      ',spam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	0811806960	December 7, 1999	43	43	5.0	Not for everyone, but intriguing nonetheless	 Lets get one thing out into the open right now: if you only like a plotted story with a clear beginning, a developed middle, and a firm, tidy ending, then you will probably be frustrated by "Griffin &  Sabine."  Those who value imaginative stories, open endings, and  haunting artwork are encouraged to read further. This lush, beautiful,  eerie and somewhat baffling trilogy relates a series of letters and  postcards between two artists living half a world apart.  The story is told  entirely through the letters themselves; however, there is a twist sure to  delight the voyeur in all of us.  All the correspondence is printed as if  it were in its original form, so we see the postcards, and in order to read  the letters, we must remove them from the envelopes pasted within the book.   This gives the reader the slightly "naughty" thrill of going  through another persons mail. As for what actually happens between  Griffin and Sabine or who they might really be, I will leave for the reader  to ponder.  Suffice it to say that Bantocks beautifully illustrated series  will make a pleasantly diversion for those with an eye for the unusual.      ',nonspam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	019510594X	December 7, 1999	9	9	5.0	Wonderful look at a bygone era	 Ethan Mordden is one of the finest writers working in the area of musical theatre and opera.  His insights are not only spot-on but witty and revealing.  This book is another welcome addition to his works and to the  works written about American musical theatre. It is difficult to conceive  what a fertile time the 1920s was for musicals.  Today we consider  ourselves very lucky to have more than eight new musicals open on Broadway  in a season; back then, it was not uncommon to have more than five times  that many.  Morddens skill lies in his ability to delineate the feel of  the era, and he is able to dissect, with surgeon-like skill, the strengths  and liabilities of each show he discusses. He not only tackles the  well-known shows of the decade ("Sally," "No, No,  Nanette," "Good News," "Show Boat") but gives  equal attention to the flops as well.  Operetta and musical revues such as  George Whites Scandals or Ziegfelds Follies are also given plenty of  coverage.  In fact, I cant think of a major show from this era that  Mordden does not cover.  It is clear that Mordden loves and respects his  subject.  He knows, too, that many of the shows of this time are thin and  poorly constructed, but he never sidesteps or apologizes for this material.   If you are looking for hard-core facts, this is not the book for you:  Mordden is somewhat skimpy in giving particular dates.  But if you want an  entertaining and comprehensive analysis of a dizzying time in the American  theatre, give this book a try.      ',spam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	B000000SQY	December 3, 1999	8	8	5.0	An underrated set	 When this set was first released a couple of years ago, I hesitated in purchasing it because of the mostly negative reviews it received.  I should stop listening to the critics.   Carlo Rizzis recordings of "La  Traviata" and "Rigoletto" are both highly enjoyable and well  conducted.  This one is no exception -- Rizzi leads a spirited, engaging  performance that nicely balances Verdis lyricism and drama, never trying  to smooth over parts that other conductors do because of their perceived  "vulgarity." The cast is quite good, certainly much better than  critics have given them credit for.  Richard Leech sings with heady beauty  and handsome tone; forget Cura and Alagna, he outclasses both of them.   Vladimir Chernov does here what he excels at, namely, spinning out a rich,  velvety voice, and singing with an authority that is quite compelling.  The  mezzo, Elena Zaremba, is a bit gusty and not ideally steady, but her dark,  Russian, contralto-like tones are right on for Ulrica.  Maria Bayo is a  charming Oscar, with clean, sharp coloratura and without a trace of acidity  in the voice.  She is my favorite Oscar on records. Which brings us to  the Amelia of Michele Crider.  Judging by the harsh reviews she has  received, one would expect an large, unwieldy, undersupported voice of  limited dramatic expression.  How unjust that verdict is can be heard by  listening to her first aria, "Ma dall arido stelo divulsa."   Crider is dramatically alive and possesses a warm, rich spinto soprano:  brilliant and blazing at the top, full and creamy at the middle, strong and  steady at the bottom.  She can sing with clarion power or spin a high  pianissimo line reminiscent of Caballe.  Critics have not been kind (I  cannot understand why), but I for one would like to hear more from Ms.  Crider. All in all, this is an engaging and highly enjoyable performance  of "Ballo," perhaps not the best available, but one to which I  will frequently return.      ',spam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	B000002SJL	December 1, 1999	21	21	5.0	Still takes my breath away	 I bought this set ten years ago when it first came out and thought it was absolutely incredible.  I recently listened to it through again and my opinion of it has only grown.  "Show Boat" is a revolutionary  musical in the history of the genre.  First produced by Florenz Ziegfeld in  1927, it was not only ground-breaking but tremedously popular.  This  recording aims to present all the music written for the show; this includes  variants, substitutions, cuts -- you name it, this set has got it.  Indeed,  the shock of the first word ("Niggers") sets the tone for this  set.  "Show Boat" never aims to be easy: it challenges prevailing  racial attitudes by showing the past as it was, not whitewashing the  unfortunate truth. Fortunately, besides a wealth of wonderful music and  challenging drama, the cast, chorus, conductor, and orchestra are all  top-notch.  Frederica von Stade takes the pivotal role of Magnolia with  charm and sincerity.  While one may wish for a true soprano timbre in the  role, von Stades performance is so winning that any misgivings are quickly  set aside.  Teresa Stratas as Julie sings ravishingly: after hearing  "Cant Help Lovin Dat Man" and "Bill" in the original  soprano keys, youll be discontent with the belter Julies normally heard  today.  Jerry Hadley, Bruce Hubbard, Karla Burns, David Garrison, and Paige  OHara are all equally suited to their roles and perform with total  commitment and great zest. John McGlinn is to be commended for his work  toward restoring the guts and heart to "Show Boat" after years of  its mistreatment as an operetta.  It is not that: this is an American  Opera, as surely as "Porgy and Bess" and "Street  Scene," and McGlinns care and passion for this score show in every  bar. When I listened to this set all the way through a few days ago, I  found tears coming to my eyes during the final reprise of "Ol Man  River."  Surely this sprawling, ambitious work is nothing less than  the distillation of the American experience: good (Magnolias triumph over  adversity) and bad (the racist attitudes that eventually destroy the tender  Julie).  Our nations past is littered with both glory and shame, and  "Show Boat" is here to remind us of that.      ',spam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	B000000B00	November 28, 1999	22	22	5.0	Better than youd expect	 When a contingent of mostly British forces performs the red-blooded Italian Verdi Requiem, most listeners would expect results to be a little . . . well, staid.  Fortunately, that is not the case here. When this  recording was first released, it was announced as the first complete  digital recording on one disc (almost all other recordings require two  discs).  This made me a little suspicious, as indeed do all marketing  ploys.  What matters is the performance, and what we have here is a good  one.  Richard Hickox has several other excellent recordings of masses and  oratorios to his credit, and this one is no exception.  He shapes and  moulds the line with an almost unerring rightness and slights neither the  passion nor the piety within this score.  Despite the fact that the piece  is on a single disc, none of the speeds feels rushed. For his soloists,  Hickox has chosen a team of mostly unknowns, with the exception of Robert  Lloyd, whose tone has grown woolly over the years.  However, Lloyd sings  with conviction and strength, as do the tenor and mezzo, Gabriel Sade and  Markella Hatziano.  Best of all is the soprano, Michele Crider.  She has  gotten some bad reviews for the few recordings she has made (this one,  Amelia in "Ballo" and Margherita in "Mefistofele") but  I simply cannot understand why.  The voice is full and warm, with a stong  lower range and a gleaming top.  However, for this work the soprano also  needs plenty of pianissimo on high.  Happily, Crider can deliver the goods  here as well, with notes that hang delicately suspended in the air with an  almost supernatural beauty.  She is less dramatically involved here than  she was in her "Ballo" recording, but then again this is not an  opera.  She hasnt recorded anything for a few years now -- I certainly  hope we havent heard the last of her. Chorus and orchestra are both fine  -- the choir is not on the same level as Robert Shaws in this work, but  then whose is?  The one small snag is that the recorded sound can tend to  overbrightness, with an occasional edge on the violins.  However, this is a  very minor quibble.  If you have room in your collection for another Verdi  Requiem, or if you are coming to this work for the first time, this  recording is enthusiastically recommended.      ',spam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	0805059962	November 27, 1999	8	8	5.0	A Valuable addition to our knowledge of Anne Frank	 Melissa Mueller states at the beginning of this book that she does not intend for this volume to be a replacement for the diary, but rather an adjunct to it.  This goal has been acheived admirably through extensive  interviews and research, giving insights in not only Annes life before and  after her experiences in hiding, but also shedding light on the various  family members and people involved. One thing Mueller accomplishes, which  may well be worth the price of the book alone, is to paint a more accurate  picture of two of the most maligned figures in Annes diary: Edith Frank  and Fritz Pfeffer (Albert Dussel in Annes pseudonym).  Especially moving  are descriptions of Ediths tenacity in keeping her daughters with her at  Auschwitz-Birkenau, and a letter written by Pfeffer to his fiancee,  Charlotte.  One would wish Mueller had been able to do the same for the van  Pels family (the van Daans in the diary), but perhaps the information  available was simply too scant. For anyone who cherishes the diary and  legacy of Anne Frank, this book will be a welcome addition to the body of  work this remarkable child has inspired.      ',spam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	B000034D59	November 27, 1999	7	7	5.0	A fitting tribute to a too little-known artist	 Today the name of Frances Alda is remembered mainly as having collaborated on several Caruso discs, but she was a fine singer in her own right, as this excellent Romophone set proves. Alda was a student of the celebrated  Mathilde Marchesi, who also taught Nellie Melba.  Indeed, at Aldas  audition, Marchesi told her husband, "Salvatore, I have found the new  Melba!"  Alda was in fact good enough to present a threat to the more  established diva, who insisted that Oscar Hammerstein chose between the two  of them:  "Either Alda or Myself!" runs the famous  telegram. Mme. Alda was one of the most colorful operatic personalities  of the early twentieth century.  She was married to Giulio Gatti-Cassazza,  head of the Met at the time, but she did not abuse her influence as a more  capricious diva might have.  She had a dry, caustic wit, as evidenced in  her autobiography, "Men, Women, and Tenors" (a thoroughly  enjoyable read, by the way). These recordings present the voice behind  the legend, and an excellent voice it is, too.  A lyric soprano of  substantial weight, she was careful to remain well inside the lyric fach,  venturing only a single Aida as an experiment.  Her favorite role was Mimi,  and it shows: her two arias from "La Boheme" are magical.  Her  high notes glitter, and the low range is full and round.  The voice is even  throughout the registers, a hallmark of the Marchesi school. The  transfers, as on all Romophone editions, are expertly done, allowing the  voice to come through with added freshness and clarity.  A wonderful set,  one of the best of the series.      ',spam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	B00002EPLJ	November 27, 1999	38	39	5.0	Finally, a truly "complete" recording!	 I never tire of defending "Oklahoma!" to those willing to dismiss it as merely musical comedy fluff.  No show which changed the format of the Broadway musical can be dismissed so casually, and let us not  forget that it contains issues of sexual harassment, territorial rights,  and includes an onstage death at the end. This particular recording is  the first ever to include the "Dream Ballet," another important  historical aspect of the show.  That fact alone puts it at the front of  current recordings of the show.  In addition, spoken sections within  numbers are included, giving the whole album a more theatrical feel than  most.  The only major musical segment not included is Ado Annies encore  verse of "I Caint Say No," but this fact shouldnt deter  listeners. It also helps that the cast is excellent.  Hugh Jackman is  more a tenor than the high baritone the role calls for, but is engaging  nonetheless, giving full rein to the characters machismo and tenderness.   Jimmy Johnston and Vicki Simon are perfect as Will and Annie, utterly  beguiling and believable in admittedly two-dimensional roles.  The always  delightful Maureen Lipman is great as Aunt Eller.  Josefina Gabrielle as  Laurey is a fine actress, but her head voice and chest voice seem to be two  separate entities and a break is evident between them.  Admittedly, Laurey  is a tough role vocally, being a soprano in a very low tessitura.  However,  Gabrielle makes up for any vocal shortcomings with her truly winning  performance. The sound is fantastic, and this is one of the few British  cast recordings of an American musical in which the accents are uniformly  excellent.  For devotees of Rodgers and Hammerstein, for lovers of classic  musicals, and for anyone who may be curious, I highly recommend this new  recording.      ',spam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	B0000028WT	November 27, 1999	25	25	5.0	Vital performance	 Every classical music lover has certain albums or discs that they have a particular fondness for, in spite of what the critical consensus may be.  This recording of Verdis Requiem is one of mine.  In our current era of  flawless ensemble and bloodless excellence above all, Ormandy leads a  highly charged, individual performance of this masterpiece. The soloists  (despite the dismissal in the Penguin Guide) are all excellent, with  particular honors going to Richard Tucker and Lucine Amara, whose  pianissimo B-flat in the "Libera me" is exquisite.  She is one of  those artists taken for granted during her time, but whose talent and  commitment would be most welcome today. Ormandy has an (undeserved)  reputation of being dependable but dull; however, on this recording he is  anything but run-of-the-mill.  Listen to the frenzy he whips up at the  beginning of the "Dies Irae" (terrific sound, by the way --  listen to that bass drum!) or the beauty with which he shapes the  "Recordare."  This is a conductor who is in the service of the  music, not the other way around.  This is most refreshing, especially since  so many uber-maestros tend to turn this work into a showcase for how  idiosyncratic their style can be. The performance of Rossinis  "Stabat Mater" which accompanies this set is more of a  disappointment.  I prefer the Chung recording on DG or the Hickox on  Chandos.  But no matter.  At super-bargain price, this "Requiem"  should not be passed by!      ',spam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	B00000JQGG	November 27, 1999	9	10	5.0	Donizetti Rarities	 Opera Rara has done more towards unearthing forgotten and neglected bel canto works than any other record company, and for that, they deserve to be commended.  The additional fact that virtually everything they produce is  so well recorded, performed, and packaged is another bonus. The present  recording is no exception.  It presents alternate numbers written by  Donizetti as additional or replacement material for several of his operas.   The overtures are pleasant enough, but it would have been nice to have even  more vocal material, for the selections included are truly fine. The  singers are up to their assignments, with the notable exception of Rockwell  Blake, who has lost the freshness and ease of tone found on his Mozart and  Rossini discs during the 1980s.  However, Nelly Miriciou once again does  herself proud, singing with dramatic intensity and excellent technical  aplomb, while newcomer Garry Magee takes the baritone roles with beautiful  tone and full commitment.  An excellent disc.      ',nonspam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	0931340608	November 26, 1999	4	5	5.0	Patti IS a music festival!	 The above quote, from Patti herself, pretty much sums things up.  Adelina Patti was, undoubtedly, the most famous singer of the 19th century.  In Mr. Cones exhaustively researched book (in appendix form are lists of her  roles, recordings, stage and concert appearances), the life of this  extraordinary diva is examined.  She started as a child prodigy, and made  her official operatic debut at the age of sixteen (!) in "Lucia di  Lammermoor."  Patti lived in an age when operatic star power reigned  supreme, and Cone includes tales of her capriciousness to highlight that  fact.  However, Patti was a true artist, able to even melt the hardest of  hearts, including George Bernard Shaw.  This is a marvelous book for anyone  interested in singers and/or famous women of the 19th century.      ',nonspam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	B000003LNL	November 26, 1999	6	9	4.0	Intriguing	 This recording, one of Opera Raras earliest, presents the 1838 version of Donizettis "Gabriella di Vergy" (not to be confused with "Gemma di Vergy").  This opera is unique in the Donizetti canon  because it was one he composed without a prior commission in 1826.  He  revised it again in 1838, but the opera did not receive a staged  performance until over thirty years later, in a version cobbled together  from various Donizetti operas. The full history and story of the opera  are documented in the copious notes provided with this set.  The music is  not first-rate Donizetti, but can achieve moments of loveliness and drama.   The casting is good but lacks the last degree of polish.  Ludmilla Andrew  in the title role sings with lovely tone, although notes above the staff  tend to constrict and do not "float" as one would ideally wish.   She is always dramatically alive, however.  Maurice Arthurs voice is only  serviceable in music which cries out for the beauty of voice and the  commitment of a young Pavarotti.  He is the weak link in this cast.   Conversely, Christian du Plessis is the most successful of the soloists,  firm in his line and fully bringing out the conflicting emotions within his  character.  John Tomlinson is not as steady as he can be, but sings with  imposing assurance in the role of the king.  Allun Francis conducts with  real feeling for the music. As a bonus, the set includes two arias and a  duet from the 1826 "Gabriella," beautifully sung by Della Jones  and Eiddwen Harrhy.  All in all, a highly enjoyable set.      ',nonspam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	0385240236	November 25, 1999	29	29	5.0	A must for anyone interested in Anne Frank	 This edition of the famous diary of Anne Frank is unlike any other.  Subtitled "The Critical Edition" it includes not only the published version in the translation by Mrs. B. M. Mooyaart-Doubleday, but  also everything that was withheld -- at the request of Annes father --  from the original published version. While in hiding, Anne heard on a  radio broadcast that after the war the Dutch government wanted to collect  memoirs and diaries of citizens wartime experiences.  Anne decided to  start a revision of her diary, clarifying certain passages and adding in  more detail, while deleting items that she deemed unimportant or too  personal (Anne wrote very candidly about her own sexuality).  The critical  edition of her diary includes Annes first diary, her revisions, and the  final, published version. In addition, this volume contains exhaustively  researched sections on the arrest and betrayal of the members of the  "Secret Annex," the publishing history of the diary, an account  of the creation of the play version, a chronicle of the attacks made on the  diarys authenticity, and an incredibly meticulous handwriting analysis  comparing letters known to have been written by Anne with excerpts from the  diary itself. I first read "The Diary of Anne Frank" when I was  thirteen years old.  I reread it about every three or four years and it  speaks to me on a new level every time.  It has become my all-time favorite  book.  With this beautiful edition, I am once again disovering this amazing  document and this remarkable child.      ',spam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	B000003LNT	November 25, 1999	8	9	5.0	Another feather in Opera Raras cap	 This installment in Opera Raras "Hundred Years of Italian Opera" project again reveals a treasure trove of lovely melody and high operatic drama.  The examples are well-chosen and really lovely,  making one wonder at their neglect.  One can almost hear history in the  making, as these composers push the boundaries of musico-dramatic  conventions.  Listen, for example, to the excerpt from Mercadantes  "Amleto," a Italian version of "Hamlet" which plays  fast and loose with Shakespeare but is marvelous on a musical level.   Mercadante includes whistling piccolos in the orchestration, which sound  eerily like human screams, a truly bone-chilling effect.  I was reminded of  the "Dies Irae" of Verdis Requiem.  There is also a lovely aria  a due from "Rosmonda" by Coccia, sung deliciously by Yvonne Kenny  and Diana Montague.  Kenny, who is featured prominently in this set, has  lost some of the ease of her highest notes but sings with a beautiful line  and an alertness to the dramatic situation.  Other singers include Nuccia  Focile, Della Jones, Bruce Ford, and Alistair Miles.  An essential set for  the lover of bel canto and for those who enjoy discovering (unjustly)  forgotten works.

' A104KYSJJZLWB4	B000000SQY	November 23, 1999	1	1	5.0	Unjustly maligned	 When this set was first released a couple of years back, all the reviews  dismissed it as a failure.  I truly cannot understand why.  Certainly, its  not the greatest "Ballo" ever recorded, but it is a strong,  persuasive performance.  Richard Leech sings with heady beauty of tone and  a real feeling for line -- forget Alagna and Cura, Leech outclasses both of  them.  Vladimir Chernov does here what he does best -- namely, sing with a  vocal richness and beauty which is rare in the modern crop of Verdi  baritones.   Michele Crider has been unjustly criticized: this is the  first recording I have heard of her, and from what Ive read I expected to  hear a hooty, gusty, ill-supported soprano.  What I got instead was a rich  voice, brilliant and blazing at the top, full and rich at the bottom, able  to negoatiate the subtle piano passages beautifully.  It also helps that  Ms. Crider sings with a real feeling for the text (listen to "Ecco  lorrido campo" and the following aria).  The voice might not have the  ultimate degree of rock-solid steadiness that such sopranos as Margaret and  Leontyne Price bring to this music, but that is in keeping with the  vacillating nature of Amelias character.  I hope to hear more from Ms.  Crider. Elena Zaremba as Ulrica may be the weak link in the cast --  changes in register do not always happen smoothly -- but she brings a dark,  ominous sound perfectly in keeping with the character.  Maria Bayo is a  charmer in the breeches role of Oscar.  There is no trace of acidity or  shrillness in her voice, merely lovely tone with excellent coloratura.  She  is my favorite Oscar on records. All in all, this recording is much more  of a success than critics would have us believe.  I got a great deal of  enjoyment out of this set, and I recommend it highly.      ',spam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	B000003LNS	November 7, 1999	11	11	5.0	Stupendous	 I have come to expect that any release from Opera Rara recordings will be intruiging at the very least, and truly marvelous at best.  This set is a real example of the latter.  Any lover of bel canto opera cannot do without  this set, and even if you are not a devotee of the bel canto period, I urge  you to hear this recording.  There are many gems here, not least several  selections from Donizetti and Meyerbeers earliest Italian operas, as well  as items from the unjustly neglected Mayr and Pacini, as well as a lovely  concert aria from Carl Maria von Weber.  Some items look back to the  elegant classical line of Mozart and Haydn, while others preface the rise  of the decorated florid cantilena made popular by Rossini.  There are only  two items which I would label as somewhat banal (one a duet by Manuel  Garcia, famous tenor and father Pauline Viardot and Maria Malibran), but  the rest is enchanting and reminds us what a fertile period this was for  Italian opera.  Everything is beautifully sung by a group of excellent  singers, including Yvonne Kenny, Della Jones, Chris Merritt and Alistair  Miles.  A delightful set, well worth the price.      ',spam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	B000003FZL	November 3, 1999	18	18	5.0	Simply lovely	 This, the opera that first brought Rossini fame, is a rather dramatically run-of-the-mill affair.  Hero believes heroine unfaithful, fights for her honor anyway, and realizes the entire time that she has been true to him.   But the music is quite wonderful, and sung with brilliance and conviction  by the entire cast.  The Bulgarian mezzo, Kasarova, is marvelous, her dark  tone and rock-solid florid technique ensure that one does not forget she is  playing a man.  Eva Mei floats lovely pianissimos and sings her coloratura  with assurance, while managing to put some character to this  one-dimensional role.  Ramon Vargas proves himself a Rossini tenor par  excellence, and the rest of the cast is strong.  RCA provides both finales  Rossini wrote for the opera, one with a "happy" ending (Tancredi  lives) and one with a tragic ending (Tancredi dies).  There are also two  arias for the hero and heroine in an appendix.  Very full, complete  recording.  A must for Rossini and bel canto enthusiasts.      ',nonspam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	B000003LNM	November 3, 1999	17	18	5.0	Charming Meyerbeer	 This work, a staple of such prime donne as Adelina Patti and Amelita Galli-Curci, has all but disappeared from modern opera stages.  Thankfully, the people at Opera Rara have produced this recording, so those of us who  are curious may see just what the opera has to offer.  While it is not a  masterpiece, it is quite charming and filled with much delightful music,  not the least of which is the most famous aria, the heroines "Shadow  Song."  That aria is well sung by Deborah Cook, small and fleet of  voice (not unlike Galli-Curci) and capping the aria with a high F.  The  rest of the singers are great, with Della Jones and Marilyn Hill Smith in  small roles.  It goes without saying that Opera Raras packaging and  presentation are first-rate.  An important addition to operatic recordings.      ',spam

All the singers are first rate, with special mention going to Bruce  Ford, one of the finest tenors working in this repertoire, and Nelly  Miriciou, who sings the title role with complete conviction reminiscent of  Callas, without her predecessors unsteadiness.  This may not be a lost  masterpiece, but it is a highly enjoyable addition to the recorded  Donizetti canon.  As always, Opera Raras presentation puts all other  complete opera sets to shame, with its deluxe packaging and first-rate  booklet and notes, detailing the history of the opera.  Fantastic.

One of the finest British singers of her generation, Jones sings with fire and passion, always  dramatically involved.  The selection of arias is a fascinating one,  including a lovely aria for the hero from Donizettis very first opera.   Nothing here is from the "standard" repertory, so even devotees  of bel canto should find something new to savor.  Highly recommended.      ',nonspam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	B00000J28P	October 20, 1999	4	6	4.0	Not great, but fun	 Okay, so "Flower Drum Song" might not be great theatre and might not be top-drawer Rodgers and Hammerstein.  But it is lovely and contains some sharp moments.  "A Hundred Million Miracles" is enchanting,  and ballads like "Love, Look Away" and "You are  Beautiful" cannot be passed by so easily.  "Chop Suey" is  awful, and "Sunday" is one of those tunes thats supposed to be a  hit but never really sticks in your mind no matter how often you hear it.   But, contrary to the reviewers opinion below, it DID have a small,  successful revival in New York a few years ago.  Overall, a pleasant  diversion and a must for R & H fans.      ',nonspam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	B000003FDT	October 20, 1999	6	6	4.0	Charming but lacking	 This was Rodgers and Hammersteins first foray into pure musical comedy (as distinguished from the musical plays they had been writing), and it was not a success.  The story was slight, and is essentially a retelling of the  "Oklahoma" love triangle.  However, the score is quite enjoyable,  with fun numbers like "Thats the Way it Happens," and "Its  Me."  Also, any show that contains "No Other Love," one of  the loveliest ballads R & H ever wrote, cannot be dismissed entirely.   "Me and Juliet" lacks the depth and brilliance of  "Carousel" or "The King and I," but it is quite likable  on its own merits.      ',nonspam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	B000002WEY	October 20, 1999	14	15	3.0	Maddening but necessary	 Until we get a decent recording of this wonderful score, fans of Rodgers and Hammerstein will have to settle for this stopgap.  Providing only 33 minutes of the show in truncated versions of the songs, this is the only  recording of "Allegro" ever made.  Why did no one think to record  the wonderful concert staging at "Encores!" a few years back?!   If you love Rodgers and Hammerstein, you will want this, but the poor  recorded quality and the brevity of the selections are drawbacks.  5 stars  for the show, but 3 for the recording.      ',nonspam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	B000005BHM	October 16, 1999	7	9	4.0	Valuable but dramatically dull	 I have taken much flack from my theatrically elitist friends when I defend (vehemently) the works of Rodgers & Hammerstein.  I find their shows (especially the first five) and the works of Stephen Sondheim to be among  the best things ever written for the theatre.  Not just musical theatre,  but THEATRE.  Sadly, this recording would give R & H detractors support  for their views.  While it is valuable as the only recording to include ALL  the music written for the "King and I", the cast feels  dramatically hazy and unfocussed.  Valerie Masterson sings beautifully, as  one would expect from her, but she hasnt had the time to really get to the  heart of Anna, though she does a fair job.  Christopher Lees dark black  voice fits the King, but he is too laid back for my taste.  Sally Burgess  is a fine Lady Thiang, and the most successful casting of the set.  Tinuke  Olafimihan, usually such an excellent performer, is dull and a little hooty  here.  The two boys are poor.  Valuable, then, for its completeness, but  maddening for its slackness.  For more dramatically convincing recordings,  check out the 1977 RCA version with Yul Brynner and Constance Towers, or  the fine 1996 Broadway revival with Donna Murphy and Lou Diamond Philips.

' A104KYSJJZLWB4	B000002W40	October 16, 1999	6	6	5.0	The version to start with	 Everyone who loves musicals (I feel sorry for people who dont) should have at least one recording of the "King and I" with Yul Brynner.  This is the best one available.  Not only one of the most complete  recordings of the "King and I" (all thats missing is some  underscoring and the "Small House of Uncle Thomas"), it also has  one of the best casts assembled.  Brynner is fine, the lung cancer which  killed him in 1985 very much NOT in evidence in this 77 recording.   Constance Towers is a terrific Anna, and she most certainly CAN act.  Her  "Shall I Tell You What I Think of You?" betters Gertrude  Lawrence.  Hye-Young Choi is my favorite Lady Thiang, floating her descant  in "Western People Funny" better than anyone else.  Martin  Vidnovic and June Angela are an appealing pair of lovers, and the two boys  roles are sung with energy.  A treat for lovers of musicals, Rodgers &  Hammerstein, and "The King and I."

' A104KYSJJZLWB4	B00000J2S3	October 16, 1999	19	20	5.0	Lovely, well-sung disc	 While all the arias on this disc have been recorded before, this is the first occasion I can think of in which the program is specifically devoted to the arias Mozart wrote for the talented sister of his wife, Aloysia  Weber.  The arias indicate that the singer had both a phenomenal range and  technique, both of which the present artist, Cyndia Sieden, has.  Her  singing is soft-grained and lovely, with notes above the staff always sweet  and bell-like, right up to the top G.  While she may be tempermentally a  little tame, so too was Weber, who reportedly was not much of an actress.   A lovely disc by a singer who deserves to be recorded much more frequently.

' A104KYSJJZLWB4	630197624X	October 2, 1999	14	14	5.0	As close to the original as well get	 This film version of "Show Boat," while not perfect, is the best one available.  Not only does it follow the story more closely (except for the end) but it also preserves three performances by members of the  original Broadway cast -- Sammy White, Charles Winninger, and Helen Morgan.   White is very good, his frenetic dancing a highlight, and Winninger is a  real winner as Andy.  However, Morgans performance is a revelation -- we  get a chance for once to sample a bit of musical theatre history  first-hand.  She is what Kern and Hammerstein originally intended, a frail,  touching, tender Julie, who also sings her songs in the original soprano  keys.  In addition to this, Irene Dunne as Magnolia is lovely (she took  over the role on Broadway from Norma Terris, the original Magnolia), and we  are truly lucky to have Paul Robesons Joe, the original choice for the  role.  You can hardly get closer to authenticity than this cast, and the  entire production was supervised by Kern and Hammerstein themselves.  This  film is the one to own if you want the best "Show Boat."      ',spam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	B00000K4EL	September 23, 1999	16	17	4.0	Good, but not perfect	 "Wonderful Town" is one of the frothiest, most delightful forays in the musical comedy genre ever created.  This recording will certainly bring the piece to more listeners, which is good, but it isnt the best  recording available.  By far the most successful casting here is Audra  McDonald as Eileen, her sweet, full soprano making the most out of  Bernsteins marvelous music and Comden and Greens terrific lyrics.  Kim  Criswell trades in her usual brassiness for a more throaty and wry  characterization than we are used to from her, but she makes it work well.   She seems to be singing at the extreme low end of her range at times  (especially in the "Ohio" duet) but this is because the role was  originally written for Rosalind Russell, who had an incredibly full lower  range (almost tenor-like).  The rest of the casting works fairly well, but  Rattles conducting is what keeps this set from earning top honors.  Parts  are way too slow (the spoken section in OHIO) and others way too fast: the  vamp in "Conversation Piece" needs to go at least twice as slow  as Rattle takes it, or the number loses its humor.  For better recordings  of "Wonderful Town," I recommend either of the Ros Russell  versions (the second one is slightly better) or the new, two-disc recording  with Karen Mason and Rebecca Luker, which includes all the music plus  several variants.      ',nonspam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	B00001IVPD	September 18, 1999	5	11	4.0	Good, but not a complete success	 I eagerly awaited the release of this recording because I am a great fan of Angela Gheorghiu and look forward to hearing her recordings.  This one, I am afraid, while good, cannot join the ranks of other classic recordings  (namely, Beechams, Karajans, and Pappanos).  The premise for this  recording is interesting, being a return (supposedly) to what Puccini  originally wanted.  Notes in the booklet suggest that Puccini wanted it  faster and less lingering than most conductors took it.  While this  recording is a bit brisker than most, there is nothing earth-shatteringly  different that listeners will notice.       The performance itself is not  a complete success.  I have never been a real fan of Roberto Alagna, but  found his Rodolfo in Pappanos "Boheme" recording to be quite  good.  Here, alas, he mars his line with many choked sobs, typical to  tenors trying to sound "bigger" and more dramatic than they are.   This also marred his performance in Pappanos recording of "Gianni  Schicchi"  He also can no longer provide the piano singing that so  nicely shaded his performance in the previous "Boheme."   Gheorghiu sounds better, using her substantial instrument to ride the  climaxes nicely, and she can also deliver a lovely pianissimo high C at the  end of act I.  However, she sometimes sounds throaty here, although she  inhabits the character well.       The most successful casting is Simon  Keenleyside as Marcello, using a lieder-singers understanding of the text  and a beautiful baritone to create a winning portrayal.  Elisabetta Scano  sings intelligently, but her voice is small and sometimes shrill.  Her  performance recalls the tradition of the comprimarie singers who often  performed the role in the first half of this decade.  A decent enough  recording, but "Boheme" needs -- and deserves -- more.      ',nonspam
' A104KYSJJZLWB4	B000002RWC	September 18, 1999	8	8	5.0	Marvelous	 My admiration for this recording grows more every time I hear it.  The agreed-upon classic set is the Bjoerling/De Los Angeles version, but I think this is the one I will listen when I want to hear the opera in  beautiful, warm, digital (not to mention stereo) sound.  I am not a fan of  Roberto Alagna, but he sings quite well and with much commitment here.  He  manages some lovely piano phrases in the quartet.  Leontina Vaduva  initially struck me as light-voiced for Mimi, but I now feel there is a  lovely, touching pathos in the delicate sound of her voice.  It is a  beautiful instrument, reservations aside.  Thomas Hampson and Ruth Ann  Swenson are completely marvelous as Marcello and Musetta, Hampson engaging,  intelligent and wry, and Swenson sweeping through the score with a voice  that puts most other recorded Musettas to shame.  Pappano conducts a  performance both lively and lush, and all supporting roles are strongly  sung.  This is the one to have if you want a good digital recording of the  opera.      ',spam
' A104VHIMHTA3V9	B000002N2V	November 11, 2003	4	5	5.0	Gone	 This is my favorite Dwight album.  Although the songwriting was not as quality as *This Time*, the songs as a cohesively engaging album flow from one to another unlike anything else the man has ever recorded.  The cover/insert artwork is also among his best, thematically coinciding with the music.  Just look at those moody pictures of him reading the newspaper in the empty room and then brooding the night city streets with the hookers.  I like how the record starts with four upbeat songs as he goes through the lovin n leavin stage, then slows down into the dark aftermath of cigarette smoke and salty tears.  The music is a vibrant atmosphere of distorted guitars, melancholic organs, and sweeping strings.  Songs like "Nothing", "One More Night" and "Dont Be Sad" rank among Dwights finest, but again, its the ten tracks as a whole that create a sharp, fast story that will really captivate the listener.  Eclectic, mysterious, sexy, witty, those are the words that describe *Gone*.  A true work of art! thank you      ',spam
' A104VHIMHTA3V9	B00005T30L	November 11, 2003	0	0	5.0	Its not me thats weird, its the rest of the world	 Well, sometimes you put together a slice-of-life film about two people who are totally clueless as to how to interact with society.  So, we have this basic theme about self-deemed losers who are are totally unable (or totally unwilling) to adjust to and interact with the "Ghost World" around them.   On the surface, the two characters couldnt be anymore different, but both have the same motive for their indifferent attitudes towards the purpose of life.  Enid is an immature teenager with a chip on her shoulder, struggling to find any sense of identity, let alone a direction.  She comes from a broken home, living with a father who scarcely knows her.  40-year-old Seymour is more seasoned and is less na ve and more accepting of the way life treats him.   Hes an introverted bachelor music-nerd with a slew of unattractive habits and personality traits.  Enid and Seymour are not rebelling from society--they are simply clueless and careless regarding their reputation among others.  They both feel rejected and misunderstood, or as Seymour puts it, `Some people, you just give them a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and theyre satisfied.  The two of them unite inauspiciously when Enid plays a cruel joke on Seymour, but quickly finds herself inquisitive of the man.  She befriends him, and they hit it off relating to and trying to help each another with their problems.  However, the movie ends with a sense of apathy and despair for both characters.   The supporting characters, with the exception of Enids girlfriend, are chiefly there to add some badly-needed comedy to a somewhat dragging plot.  The actors have a sharp script to sink their teeth into, with Steve Buschemi being the highlight-everything this man touches turns to gold!  All things considered, a fantastic film that explores the depths of human loneliness and indifference. Thank You      ',spam

"The Silence of the Lambs" came out in 1991, when it seemed like movies shifted back and forth between kookie freakshows(Children of the Corn)and prepackaged action flicks(Terminater 2).  In this climate, "Silence" was like a breath of fresh air to thriller fans looking for something with a little more substance.  The film actually contains only one really graphic scene.  Most of the horror is created by the uncertainty and suspense in the plot, as well as some mighty fine acting(Anthony Hopkins take a bow).  The script focuses on two vicious and mysterious criminals, both very volatile, yet with very different psyches.  The films daring turns and twists continue all the way to its climax when the FBI agent (Jodie Foster) and the wanted serial killer (Ted Levine) meet face to face almost by pure chance!  More interesting than this, however, is Fosters dialogue scenes with the imprisoned madman, Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins).  Well, I wont go on with all the details and spoil it for you, so I just say this:  If you like suspence-filled thrillers that make you think, buy this movie today.  It is one of the best of all-time in its genre! Thanks for reading.      ',spam
' A104VHIMHTA3V9	B00006CXIL	October 22, 2002	4	8	5.0	Panic Room	 Okay, as some of the negative reviews have pointed out, this isnt quite a thrilling horror flick like the title may suggest.  To fully appreciate this excellent film, one must drop all expectations and presumptions at the door.   Now, "Panic Room" is no-doubt a thriller, but it has an unusual dosage of humor and unlikely castings.  Forest Whitakers soft heart, Jared Letos comical stupidity, and Dwight Yoakams impulsive rage are indeed an odd combination for such a film.  Add in the the fact that this is not your typical cat-and-mouse game between a cop and a criminal, and "Panic Room" is truely one of the freshest productions to come along in a good while!  Jodie Foster and Kristen Stewart handle their roles to a tee, but it is the villians who are the gleaming highlight.  The characters played by Leto and Whitaker both have weaknesses that make them seem almost harmless, allowing for respite from the dramatic action.  By the middle of the film, youll realize both of them are far from the bonafide, heartless killers you may have intially thought them to be.  Nonetheless, Yoakam makes sure the viewer gets his/her share of shakes and jolts as his homocidal character progressively gets more and more out of control throughout the film.  "Raoul" starts off as if hes just a quiet assistant to Leto and Whitaker, but he soon takes control of the scrape with his quick instincts and cold-blooded decisions.   Overall, "Panic Room" doesnt contain the all-out viciousness, nor the head-scratching mystery that most thrillers live and die by.  In place of this is a creative plot and some very interesting character interaction.  The script is sharp, not wasting any time on narritives or character backgrounds. Finchners fast-moving camera work is the icing on the cake that makes this a fine thriller.  "Panic Room" is smart, quick, and is sure to keep you glued! Thanks!      ',spam
' A104VHIMHTA3V9	B000002KDB	September 5, 2002	1	2	5.0	Pieces of the Sky	 Emmylous first major label debut, and what a fantastic way to start what has become a great career! *Pieces of the Sky* is an excellent blend of down-home country, folk, and rock. For the most part, the album is pretty off-beat, containing several mello country folk ballads and a few honkytonkers that pick up the pace in between. My favorite track is the shattering "Berfore Believing", which features a heavenly acoustic guitar hook and a serpentine melody.  Another favorite is Shell Silversteins "Queen of the Silver Doller" and Harris self-penned "Boulder To Birmingham".  Harris also takes her cracks at more up-beat stuff with Merle Haggards roudy barroom classic "The Bottle Let Me Down" and the bouncy strut of "If I Could Only Win Your Love".  However, its the wistful, pensive  ballads where her vocal beauty gleams the brightest.  Just take one listen to the romantic, sweeping sound of "Too Far Gone"! Emmylou Harris and her band keep these songs relatively simple and acoustic. Just a little electric guitar and snappy drums here and there to give the album a contemporary touch. Emmylou rarely writes her own material, but her pasionate vocal interpretations make the songs seem as if theyre her own. Definitely worth the admission price!  Thank You      ',spam
' A104VHIMHTA3V9	0790740176	July 8, 2002	0	0	5.0	Fandango	 This is a hip flick! This is one of those low-budget, spontaneous films where all the actors look like theyre having fun while making it. Kevin Reynolds did a nice job with the script, the setting, the desert scenery, and the filming. Kevin Costner & Co. are terrific and Marvin J. McIntyre is a riot! The part where hes scribbling all over the chalk board, trying to explain how to parachute out of an airplane is just hilarious. All five of "The Groovers" come from a different background. They all have different personalities, different plights, which makes things very interesting.  One of the boys is intent upon becoming a preacherman, another one is having second thoughts about getting married, while another one simply has no clue where hes going.  Judd Davis is anxiously awaiting his enlistment into the military and Vietnam, while Costner has been hanging around in College for several years trying to avoid the draft.  Despite their growing differences, they all decide to come together for one last fling before they go their own ways in life.  I loved the soundtrack to this movie as well! Los Lobos, Steppenwolf, Carol King, Blind Faith, etc. I think people of all ages, males and females, will like this film. Buy "Fandango" today and youll be thoroughly entertained! Thanks      ',spam
' A104VHIMHTA3V9	B00005KG65	July 8, 2002	9	9	5.0	Straight From The Holler	 This is the best country album released in 2001 that I know of.  For years, Patty Loveless has made terrific albums.  On "Mountain Soul", Loveless harks back to the acoustic, no percussion, bluegrass music she grew up with.  Get this album and just sit and listen to the edgy dobros, crashing mandolins, the haunting fiddles, and of course, Pattys heartfelt voice singing those insightfull lyrics.  Three tracks that particularly stand out for me are *Out of Control Raging Fire*,*Youll Never Leave Harlan Alive*, a descriptive saga, and a song that Patty wrote herself, *Sounds of Loneliness*.  Ricky Skaggs and Travis Tritt lend their voices and instrumental abilities and Emory Gordys production is right on. There is not one song on here that falls short of being enjoyable.  Patty seems to be well on her way to becoming a lengend. Recommended! thank you      ',spam
' A104VHIMHTA3V9	B000003KDG	June 21, 2002	1	1	5.0	The Untouchables	 An action filled history film thatll keep you on the edge of your seat! The depiction of 1930s Chicago and the accuracy of the events is great and even better yet, the casting/acting is terrific! Kevin Costner shines here in one of his breakthrough films with his role as a classic good-guy hero, in this case its Treasury Cop Elliot Ness. Sean Connery delivers a remarkable performance as the hard-nosed, confrontational policeman "Malone", who has nothing to loose. And of course, Robert Di Nero fits his role as head gangster Al Capone to the nth degree. All the co-stars do a nice job as well.  Its rare when a big-budget history movie can be so artsy, so precise. One of the best mobster flicks ever!  Thank You      ',spam
' A104VHIMHTA3V9	B000007NYS	June 17, 2002	6	7	5.0	Dazzeling Songcraft + A Unique Voice = Great Artist!	 She won the prestigious Grammy Album of the Year award for "Car Wheels On A Gravel Road", but I feel that this self-titled 1988 album is her finest! Youve got wonderfull narrative songs like *The Nights Too Long* and *Crescent City*.  Then theres the playfull lament of the tex-mex *Big Red Sun Blues*, the folk-rock roll of *Passionate Kisses* (which is probably the highlight of the record}, and the raunchy *I Asked For Water*.  My favorite cut is the melancholy *Abandoned*, which has a beautifull electric guitar solo.  The book includes a quote from Lucindas father making an analogy to how her music is so versatile, so uncategorizable. Lucinda can comfortably include material like the harmonica/electric guitar bluesy rock of *Changed The Locks* to the tender country balladry of *Am I Too Blue For You*. Yet, the album always maintains a tight focus, none of the songs sound out of place. Williams also included 6 bonus tracks, including acoustic blues covers like *Disgusted* and *Nothing In Rambling* as well as a beautifull folk ballad, *Sundays*. Lucinda can get very literal and detailed with her lyrics, which makes her songs all the more emotional and mysterious! The thing that struck me the most, though, was the raw, spontaneous, and inspired sound of Lucinda and her band. The musicianship and the production is very lively sounding. Like they just went into the studio, let the tapes roll, started playing, and wa la, youve got an album! The guitar hooks are edgy and catchy, and Williams voice is pasionate and dynamic throughout all eighteen tracks. Emmylou Harris, Tom Petty, Mary Chapin Carpenter, and Patty Loveless all covered something from this album. If you discovered this talented lady through "Car Wheels", youll love this record as well. Thank you!      ',spam
' A104VHIMHTA3V9	B000002L9P	June 17, 2002	1	1	5.0	Storms of Life	 A wonderful album from country renaissance man Randy Travis! Every song is a keeper and every song has a different story to tell. Best of all is the opening song, *On The Other Hand*. Just listen as the backing chorus comes in after the first verse. Randy also includes bouncy honkytonk on tracks like *The Storms of Life* and *1982* , some country blues with *Messin With My Mind*, and even a little comedy with *There Always Be A Honkytonk Somewhere*.  Of course, his specialty seems to be the soulfull ballads, but Randy also proves he can handle a faster tune with the swinging *My Heart Cracked*.  Travis vocals are smooth and steady as he delivers each song with confidence and ease.  The lyrical content harps back to the simple things in life and nature.  This album will take you to that gravel road in the countryside---grassy fields and tall trees on both sides. Thank You      ',spam
' A104VHIMHTA3V9	B00004XQ83	June 5, 2002	4	5	5.0	Lives up to the hype, no doubt about it.	 "O Brother Where Art Thou" is fantastic! This record is not only introducing a new generation of music fans to bluegrass roots music, but its doing it with a slew of top-notch songs thatll get stuck in your head for weeks. Each of the tracks on here offers something different for the listener. Youve got the eerie vocals of Emmylou, Alison, and Gillian on *Didnt Leave Nobody But The Baby*, the sheer acapella simplicity of Ralph Stanleys *O Death*, and the original recordings of bluegrass folk standards *Angel Band* and *Big Rock Candy Mountain*. You also get a taste of the blues and its relationship to bluegrass with Chris Thomas Kings *Hard Time Killing Floor Blues*. --- It has always been said that country music and blues music are just a beat away! Even the instrumental versions of *I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow* add flavor to the album and also bring out something new to the song itself. Then theres the reworked covers of familiar songs like *In The Jailhouse Now* and *You Are My Sunshine*. Alison Krauss and the backing choir in *Down To The River To Pray* will take your breath away and who can ever forget the bouncy instrumentation and catchy lyrics in the Soggy Bottom Boys *I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow*. As a whole, the soundtrack will paint lots of pictures in your mind, primarily taking you to a dusty road in the middle of a tallgrass field. The songs range from hardcore bluegrass to "newgrass", making this a nice introduction for new fans of the genre. Pick this record up today and join in on the fun, for you will not be disappointed!

' A104VHIMHTA3V9	B000001FMJ	May 22, 2002	5	5	5.0	The Lonesome Jubilee	 Mellencamp took his romantic fascination with the heartland to the max with "The Lonesome Jubilee".  Lyrically, he doesnt really break any new ground here: The album is dominated by social commentary and vivid narritives of the life of the regular American.  However, the quality of the songs is remarkable and John brings in a variety of instruments that you rarely hear on a "rock n roll" record.  From the opening accordion and dobro guitar riffs of *Paper In Fire*, "Jubilee" is mostly upbeat.  Songs like *Down And Out*, *The Real Life*, *Hard Times For An Honest Man* roll along passionatly.  Mellencamp brings in a strident working class anthem in *We Are The People* and also a few deep, melancholy stories with *Empty Hands* and *Hotdogs and Hamburgers*.  You can almost feel the despair of the characters in the songs when John uses words like "Oh lord, what did I do to deserve these empty hands" or "My daddys always drunk, my moms a babysitter, and I dont like the Russians cause I hear they hate me".  On the other hand, the carefree *Rooty Toot Toot* breathes a little Mellencampesque comedy into the record.  Finally, theres two songs on here that are worth the admission price alone.  Listen for the beautifull fiddle work on the nostalgic *Cherry Bomb*. With its catchy accordion hook, building melody, and crafty lyrics, *Check It Out* is probably Mellencamps finest song!  All in all, "The Lonesome Jubilee" is a fantastic recording, where John Mellencamp, Middle American ambassador that he is, is at the top of his game.  The eclectic instrumentation, the themes, and the emotions in these songs will blow you away! Thanks!      ',spam
' A104VHIMHTA3V9	B000002MJ8	April 26, 2002	0	0	5.0	This Time	 Renaissance man Dwight Yoakam goes with all kinds of styles here, weaving it all into an eleven song album that you wont be able to get enough of. Every song is superb and each one offers something different. Dwight is in a devistated, almost pathetic mood here and he simply doesnt let up throughout this self-pity story.  As an album, "This Time" doesnt really hang together as well as some of Yoakams other recordings. What is striking about this album is the diversity of the songs.  Refreshing forgotten honkytonk sounds and cool rock n roll, the album is definately Dwights most off-beat recording (most of these songs are ballads).  *Pocket of a Clown* is a 50s-tinged midtempo tune with the colorful lyrics: Hollow lies make a thin disguise as little drops of truth fall from your eyes The descriptive *Home For Sale* combines delicate dobro and acoustic guitar with a swimming organ. For the most part, Pete Andersons bluesy guitar is silenced, but his influence is still there as he experiments with some interesting styles of reverb. Check out his cheap guitar reverb on the bouncy title track or Dwights echoing vocals on the Stones-y rocker *Wildride*. Featuring a familiar melody and chillingly sad lyrics, *Two Doors Down* has to be one of the best country tear-jerkers written in the past thirty years. The very best song here though is probably the apocalyptic *A Thousand Miles From Nowhere*, with its haunting harmony and melody. The blaring electric guitars combined with the lyrics, "I got bruises on my memory / I got tear stains on my hands / and in the mirror theres a vision / of what used to be a man" will take you to another place. The lamenting *Aint That Lonely Yet* features a creative chord progression that is washed over with sweeping strings, which makes for a nice smooth intro into the honkytonkin *King of Fools*. Listen here as the waltzing fiddles and Yoakams "buh bah" vocals fade out at the end, leaving a hopeless and empty feeling in the listeners mind.  Then comes the scorching guitar licks of *Fast as You*, a red-hot rocker that recalls Roy Orbisons "Pretty Woman".  The acoustic *Try Not To Look So Pretty* has a beautiful fiddle hook.  The album concludes with the weeping *Lonesome Roads*, which takes you right to that desolate highway in the middle of a desert. Again, the variety of the songs is so stunning that you may have to relisten a few times to fully appreciate it. This is one album where Yoakam ran a high parallel between artistic achievement and an audience response. Thank You      ',spam
' A104VHIMHTA3V9	B0000002ME	April 25, 2002	16	16	5.0	Now That Ive Found You	 Covering some of her finest moments of the first decade or so of her career, "Now That Ive Found You" IS the place for the novice fan to start with this talented lady. This compilation album includes three new songs as well as four others that only appeared on tribute albums (not on any of Alisons albums). Whether shes with her Union Station band or not, Krauss always hits on all cylinders. Her vocals are dynamic and emotional, yet soft and not over-the-top. She has a deep care for keeping her personality and distictiveness in the music, and one cannot overlook her great instrumental talent (fiddle). Tired of female vocalists substituting volume for emotion in their singing? You have come to the right place! Alison and her backing musicians will blow you away on this recording!  The title track and *In The Palm of Your Hand* are wonderfull cover songs and Ms. Krauss bluegrass-pop reworking of *When You Say Nothing At All* is every bit as enjoyable as Keith Whitleys original. Also, listen for the country-blues instrumental work on *Oh, Atlanta* and *When God Dips His Pen of Love in My Heart*. My favorite Alison Krauss song is the lamenting *Everytime You Say Goodbye*. It has a beautiful melody that starts off with a bouncy mandolin and banjo and then slides into a rich fiddle solo. "And your words just are like arrows through my heart, everytime you say goodbye" is one of my favorite lyrics of all-time. The entire album is played to a light, if not non-existent percussion backbeat. Alison does a crafty job of refreshing bluegrassy music while blending in touches of pop and folk. Add in her top-notch vocals, unique phrasing and fiddling and youve got an artist who has certainly carved out a niche of their own. This album will leave you craving for more and luckily AK has put out a good 7 or 8 other records. Highly recommended! Thank You.      ',spam
' A104VHIMHTA3V9	B000002LBS	April 24, 2002	3	3	5.0	Angel Band	 This record is filled with one classic folk-gospel tune after another.  All the songs on here have that familiar sound that youll love!  *Someday My Ship Will Sail*, *Angel Band*, and *Precious Memories* seem to be the standouts.  Obviously, the dominant theme here is spiritual redemption, but Harris doesnt really try to put her own spin on these songs and act as a social interpreter of them.  Instead, she simply runs from one traditional christian song to another, as if she were the special musical guest on a Sunday afternoon.  Emmylous vocal interpretations of the songs are very sweet and subtle.  With the help of an excellent backing trio of musicians, each song is delivered with warmth and nuance.  Listen for Vince Gills tenor harmonies and mandolin picking.  Also, watch for all the beautifull, gentle guitar work by Ms. Harris.  All in all, this is a beautifull, spiritual album that is great to listen to when you need to get some work done, or if you just want to relax and have some quiet time to yourself! Thanks      ',spam
' A104VHIMHTA3V9	B000002OR0	April 8, 2002	4	4	5.0	What A Crying Shame	 The Mavericks were simply the best mainstream country band of the 90s. They had some other great albums, but this one is regarded by most fans and critics as their finest. The record features top notch musicianship and songcraft with lead vocalist Raul Malo cruising through each song with ease. Raul was also in on the writing of seven of the tracks, four of which were with the great songwriter/guitarist Kostas.  Starting with the self-pity binge *There Goes My Heart* and finishing with the heart-on-the-sleeve *The Losing Side of Me*, The Mavericks go through all the phases of the love game. Echos of Malos aching voice will haunt you throughout the Orbisonesque ballad *I Should Have Been True*. Then listen as he goes through the remorsefull *Aint Found Nobody*. The Mavs are confident troubadors, blending many retro country and rock/pop sounds. Watch as they jump from the 50s dancehall rocker *The Things You Said To Me* to the straight-ahead honkytonk of *Just a Memory*. Then comes the latin beat-driven *All That Heaven Will Allow* and into the loungy, intimate weeper *Neon Blue*. Finally, there are three fantastic moments on this record: *What A Crying Shame*, with its catchy guitar hook, steady drums, acoustic strum, and terrific organ, will tear out your heart and leave you wishing for a more "positive" story. Highlighted by its beautifull waltzing fiddles, *Pretend* is an excellent midtempo tune with a classic melody and great lyrics. A third song that strikes the middle of the target is the beautifull, romantic *O What A Thrill*, which is complete with lush strings and wonderfull piano work. As soon as the first verse starts: Oh girl in a moment I may kiss your lips, the song is an instant classic!  All in all, *What A Crying Shame* is a thrilling album from top to bottom with not a single weak song in sight. Get it as soon as you can and youll be singing and dancing right along! Thanks for reading!      ',spam
' A104VHIMHTA3V9	B000002G62	April 8, 2002	2	2	5.0	Sheryl Crow	 Sheryl Crow self-titled her second album to symbolize a new beginning, to prove herself to be more than just a "one album wonder". In comparison with the highly popular "Tuesday Night Music Club", this record has a slicker, more rocked-up sound, including some weird sound effects and a full arsenal of loud guitars and drums. Sheryl wrote/cowrote all of the songs on here, many with her guitar player, Jeff Trott, and also produced the entire album herself. Also, Ms. Crow played a variety of instruments, including the guitar, keyboard, piano, wurlitzer, and bass. Anyway, onto the songs! *Change Would Do You Good* is an upbeat rocker with a mean melody and a lyric that youll be singing to no one in particular for weeks: ...Oueen of South Beach, aging blues, Dinners at six, wear your cement shoes/ I thought you were singing your heart out to me/ Your lips were syncing and now I see... Listen as Sheryl incorporates some crafty guitars like the twangy, moody guitar in the background on *Home* and the ratteling, Stones-y one in the middle of *Sweet Rosalyn*. Sheryl speaks out her views on violence and hate in our society on songs like *Love is a Good Thing* and the classic rocker *Hard To Make A Stand*. The midtempo acoustic strum on *Oh Marie* and the inward looking *Redemption* add more variety and flavor to the album. And just try to resist the guitar hook at the beginning of *Everyday is a Winding Road* and the funky guitar solos that continue throughout the song! My favorite track is the killer cosmic rock ballad *If it Makes You Happy* with its hard-hitting electric guitars and pedal steel. All in all, quite a terrific recording that is needless to say, quintessential Sheryl Crow. Highly Recommended! Thank You      ',spam
' A104VHIMHTA3V9	B000002PDW	April 8, 2002	2	2	5.0	Guitar Town	 "Guitar Town" is essentially a roots rock album with a heartland, hillbilly twist.  Steve Earle wrote six of the ten tracks, and cowrote the other four.  His voice cuts through the listeners ears, giving you chills.  From start to finish, the record is filled with outstanding songs that youll never forget.     As a songwriter, Earle uses razor sharp lyrics, particularly noticable on the title track: Everybody told me you cant get far on thirty-seven dollars and a Jap guitar.  He wrote that song after arguing with his girlfriend on the telephone while he was out on the road doing concerts!  *Fearless Heart* is a fantastic rock ballad--watch for the spine-tingling guitar solo.  Earle brings in jangly guitars on tracks like *Gettin Tough* and *Goodbyes All We Got Left* and also includes some hard, natural country on songs like the bouncy *Think it Over*, the working-class *Hillbilly Highway*, and the acoustic *My Old Friend the Blues*.  *Someday* is the best cut of the record.  This wonderfull storytelling song includes a beautifull electric guitar solo after the second chorus, and a timeless hammered-chord acoustic strum.  Steve closes out the album with the smooth *Little Rock n Roller* and the mandolin-drenched *Down The Road*.   Steve Earle delivers each and every song with all the confidence and conviction of the long-time veteran he was when this recording was released.  Using studio musicians rather than his band seems to be the only flaw, but the remarkable high quality of the songs overcomes that.  Definitely an essential recording for any alternative country/roots rock music fan. Thank You!      ',spam
' A104VHIMHTA3V9	B000002PG7	March 29, 2002	3	3	5.0	Pontiac	 Lyle Lovett is easily one of the most complete popular musicians around these days.  He has a fantastic lonesome, bluesy voice and his songwriting and eclectic stylization is simply ingenious.  *Pontiac* is argueably his strongest piece of work, but how can one choose from such a great lineup! Lyle starts this record with the descriptive and surreal *If I Had A Boat*.  This folky, midtempo song has a beautifull, building melody and perfectly sets the tone for the album.  *Give Back My Heart* is a hilarious upbeat country-blues song, that youll be singing and humming along to immediately.  Lyle is breathtakingly bold and unpredictable, most notably when he goes through a tune where he hunts down and kills his Ex at her wedding (*LA County*), and right on into a song where he marrys a girl and sarcastically describes the restrainments of marriage! (*Shes No Lady*)  The music selection remains tasty as Mr. Lovett adds in touches of R&B (*M-O-N-E-Y*), and loungy big-band (*Black and Blue*) without losing any focus.  Another excellent song is the title track, a slow acoustic ballad with a haunting fiddle.  Lovetts vocal performances are loose and deeply inspired. Just listen to how his voice fades out at the end of Pontiac and then picks up right into the swinging *Shes Hot To Go*---"Now to find a man good loving aint an easy thing to do...", from this opening verse, hes got you hooked!   The backing band of musicians are fabulous, and Emmylou Harris and Francine Reeds backing vocals on a few of the tracks are icing on the cake!  The cerebral songs will give you chills and the witty ones will crack you up.  Lyle Lovett is truely an American treasure, and the fact that his music is rather uncategorizable makes him all the more appealing.  Wish I could give this record 6 stars, its well worth the trip!  Thanks for reading!      ',spam
' A104VHIMHTA3V9	B000002LGI	March 15, 2002	0	0	5.0	Heart Shaped World is a blue rockabilly heaven	 Chris Isaak is a rare example of a musician who has a unique ability to take a forgotten retro sound and add in a rush of utterly contemporary lyrics and presentation.  End result:  a truley refreshing and inspiring type of music!  Before this particular album, Chris was popular in Europe (after Blue Hotel hit in France), but had hardly surfaced in America.  Isaak starts things off with the rollicking *Heart Shaped World*, which perfectly sets the tone for this dark, sensual, off-beat album. For the most part, Chris Isaak stays down-beat, but there are also a few notable rockers, particularly the bluesy *Dont Make Me Dream About You*. *Diddley Daddy*, which is the only song here that Chris didnt write, is another fast tune with some hip, comical lyrics.  Then of course theres the spooky *Wicked Game*, an excellent blue rockabilly ballad featuring seductive guitar work and a decsending hook thatll get stuck in your head for days. Perhaps even better than this killer hit though is the steamy *Blue Spanish Sky*, with its Spanish resguedo acoustic strum and trumpet. *Forever Young* is kind of a neat latin surf-rock tune where Isaak is finally sounding a little less bereft.  Another great track of the record is the upbeat *Wrong To Love You*, which has a wonderfully rauscious guitar hook and a haunting melody. The songs flow from one to the other beautifully. Isaak sounds like a devistated lover yearning to avoid loves inevitably bad outcome. The production is a little slicker, cleaner than the Sun Rockabilly records and 60s loungy pop which are obviously Isaaks influences.  Nontheless, he does a great job of interpreting that vintage crystal-clear reverb with a highly contemporary outlook.  The guitars ring clearly, the drum beats arent overbaked, and the lyricism is hip (but never pretentious), which makes Isaak a rare catch in the world of loud jangle-rock and girly pop.  The musicianship of he and his trio band is fabulous and Chris uses his moody baritone vocals to perfection on all the songs.  Definitely worth it! Thank You.      ',spam
' A104VHIMHTA3V9	B000002WD2	February 18, 2002	3	3	5.0	You wont be "Killin Time" when you hear this!	 *Killin Time* is one of the finest records of modern era C&W. This record has much more to offer than the five fantastic hit singles. In fact, the other five songs probably could have been major hits as well.  Clint Black starts off the album with the snappy western swinger, *Straight From The Factory*. The song has a happy and friendly tone, but after that, Mr. Black slides into gut-wretching pain and emptiness with his deeply meaningfull, poetic lyrics and classic country melodies. *A Better Man* was one of the freshest songs to come along in years.  Featuring a thick guitar intro that leads into a deep hook, the song is lightly dusted with keyboard and acoustic guitar. *Nobodys Home* is a soulfull ballad with the perfect melody and lyrics that will tug at your heart. The sophisticated *Walkin Away* has a nice arrangement of fiddle and electric guitar. *Youre Gonna Leave Me Again* will put a good vision in your mind, bringing you right into Clints head when he says: "think Ill go down to the picture show, see if theyre playin something new". Listen for the beautifull fiddle solo at the end of this song.  *Ill Be Gone* is an upbeat, rockin tune similar to something youd find on a Buck Owens record. *Nothings News* includes a great pedal steel solo and tear-jerking lyrics thatll give you chills!--Especially where he says: "down at Ernies ice-house liftin longnecks to that good old country sound". *Winding Down* is another song where Clint is alone and is now singing about the aftermath of playin all evening in the honkytonks. My favorite cut of the record is the title track, *Killin Time*. The song has an infectious baritone guitar riff, a mean and addictive melody and hard pedal steel guitar. The album then closes with the haunting country-blues of *Live and Learn*.  The songs, all penned by Mr. Black, are very well written. I wouldnt call this a concept album, but each song tells a different story, a different chapter in the musicians life.  The production and performances are inspired and Clints vocals are smooth, superb! Black recorded this record with his road band, and it definitely shows.

' A104VHIMHTA3V9	B000002LMY	January 31, 2002	0	0	5.0	If There Was A Way	 Dwight Yoakams pen flew solo on 8 tracks on here and he also co-wrote 2 others. A little less emotional than the gut- wretching "Buenas...", *If There Was A Way* is nontheless an intense story of a rocky relationship between two people.  The black and white cover art perfectly illustrates the feelings of love-and-lost.  The record starts with the bouncy hillbilly romper *The Distance Between You and Me*, where Yoakam sings about a dead romance between a couple still living together. *The Heart that You Own* includes beautiful twin fiddles, heartfelt pedal steel, and an honest acoustic guitar strum. Dwight and the band then pick things up with the bluesy *Takes Alot to Rock You* and *Nothings Changed Here* features Dwight and lead guitarist Pete Anderson playing a classic 12 bar blues along with Scott Joss raunchy fiddle. From these turbulent songs, we go into post-mortum self-pity (Sad, Sad Music), denial(Since I Started Drinkin Again) and regret(If There Was A Way).  The barroom-ready *Turn Me Loose* has some fantastic telecastor guitar licks! At this point in the story, Yoakam has at least temporarily given up on his elusive love and is tryin to ease the bad memories. The bouyant *It Only Hurts When I Cry* was co-penned with the legendary Roger Miller. *Send A Message To My Heart* (w/Patty Loveless) is a nice healing tune where there is finally a hint of hope in the relationship.  *I Dont Need it Done*, finds Dwight telling the lady that hes moved on and found real true love.  The story ends when he slides into the tearful and vengeful *Youre the One*, which has this obsessive little snare drum tap that builds throughout the 4 minute epic.  The final two songs, *Dangerous Man* and a cover of *Lets Work Together* are sort of a bonus. I second one of the previous reviewers opinion that this music is good for both good times and bad.  Rolling Stone Magazine rated *If There Was A Way* as one of the Top 5 C&W albums of the decade.  Obviously, I recommend it!   Thank You      ',nonspam
' A104Y042UJ1ERG	B00008L3SA	November 18, 2004	4	4	4.0	A little uneven, but many hilarious moments	 Somehat uneven and not as tight in terms of plot as many other Allen films -- basically more of a setup (wacky family seeking asylum in embassy) to let the jokes roll -- but many laugh-out-loud moments and gags.  I often find Dom DeLuise to be just too much, but here he shows a little restraint and gets the priest character just right.  His "priest" has a network of intelligence behind him, & he telephones them with "subtle" coded messages such as, "The boy with the blue hair is fondling a chipmunk." He also performs some of the best magic routines Ive ever seen; best because they are so hilariously stupid.  ROFLMAO to see him giving the tricks away either as hes performing them or immediately afterward, when he casually put down the "secret" prop or whatever in plain view.  Great laughs, easy to watch -- Allen gives us one of his lowbrow characters rather than his intellectual neurotic types.  Enjoy!      ',nonspam

What a wonderful voice she has, equally at home interpreting classic favorites and contemporary numbers.  And lets not forget the wonderful players she has backing her up -- the bass and guitar work are wonderful, as is the pianist.  I got her CD on the spot, one for myself and one to give to a friend.

' A104Y042UJ1ERG	0895296306	May 27, 2003	1	1	4.0	Good recipes, nutrition information lacking	 I got this book at Easter and have made several of the recipes.  All have been good, a few outstanding. (The "good" ones were tasty but identifiable as a low-fat product.  The outstanding ones were as good as a full-fat counterpart.)  However, I cant give this book 5 stars because the nutrition information given is lacking a key aspect:  no carbohydrate information is provided.  Fat, calories, protein, etc., are all listed, but no carbohydrate.  That makes figuring American Diabetic Association or American Dietetic Association exchanges hard to do accurately.  One can make a guess of the starch exchanges from the calories, but carbohydrate information would allow one to figure exchanges much more precisely.  Since this IS a book of baked goods, not giving the carbohydrate information is like reviewing a new brand of gasoline and detailing all the ingredients EXCEPT the octane.  Hard to believe, given that the author is a nutritionist, and makes you wonder if they are trying to downplay how much sugar and complex carbs are in the recipes.  Since many "low-fat" products are unhealthy precisely because they use great amounts of sugars and starches to taste good despite the lack of fat, you have to wonder about these recipes, too.

' A104Y042UJ1ERG	157954519X	February 6, 2002	16	17	4.0	Sound advice	 Hearing Dr. Wright speak, I bought this book on the spot.  Dr. Wright does a great job applying behavior principles to common situations, in language non-behaviorists can understand.   Youll take away from his book the idea that you should look at your own unique pet in your own unique circumstances to pinpoint any behavior problems you may be having, letting just exactly what is happening, when, and where help you guess _why_.  If you can guess the why, you can plan a way to intervene that will be effective -- and youll learn how best to decide if you are indeed being effective.   Dr. Wright also emphasizes assessing the mood of your dog and changing a bad mood to a good one in order to facilitate behavior change.  He further gives good research-based information about reading dogs body language and how to respond if a dog is fearful, aggressive, etc.   But Aint Misbehavin doesnt just address problems such as aggression or separation anxiety.  On the contrary, how to build a positive relationship with your pet (so problems dont appear) is a primary focus. In sum, a really good dog AND CAT training book that both gives you guidelines for living happily with your pet and offers suggestions for responding to serious problems.      ',nonspam
' A104Y042UJ1ERG	B00003CXQS	September 4, 2001	3	4	4.0	Pleasant Surprise	 In a romantic comedy, theres no real suspense these days. Boy meets girl, and boy and girl get together, usually for keeps. The only way to add any variation to the theme is to make the characters or the setting appealing, or to have witty and/or wise dialogue. Im not sure why this movie was so panned by the critics, because _What Women Want_ surely delivers appealing characters in the form of Helen Hunt and Mel Gibson, and an interesting setting in the head offices of a large Chicago advertising firm. Yes, the movie was a bit long. I was ready for them to resolve the romance before they finally got around to it -- and Marisa Tomeis funny character is disposed of in a ridiculous and neat way that leaves the hero unscathed -- but Helen Hunt was charming and has rarely looked lovelier, and she gave the role her usual depth. Mel Gibson did a good job, and his Astaire-like dance number was an unexpected delight. I thoroughly enjoyed _What Women Want_ and felt Id been given a slice of (no doubt glamorized) life of two successful ad execs juggling job and romance in the big city. The device of having the hero be able to read womens minds was used for the most part effectively, without bashing the audience over the head with it. Certainly an imaginative way to allow the hero to grow emotionally. Now, Ill end with a comparison: this movie really was a long re-working of just about every episode of the TV show Bewitched, wasnt it? Only this time "Samantha" gets to be more overtly smart in turning everything into successful ad campaigns!      ',nonspam
' A104Y042UJ1ERG	0804113505	August 28, 2001	1	1	4.0	Complex and moving	 I have read and re-read this book. I have also recommended it to others, and everyone has liked it! The characterizations are so good, and the ending is quietly hopeful. The reader can really enjoy Muriel and Brimm as they confront how they have dealt with their dark childhood and try to grow beyond it, even as they face Brimms death. I really like the way they struggle to acknowledge painful events and learn from them -- but still not let themselves be completely defined by them. The murder mystery -- I really havent been able to grasp how that ties in with the rest of the story; it seems tacked on and out of tempo with a self-exploratory novel, but it does fit in with the emotional timbre of the book. Also, involvement in the mystery does give Muriel a chance to be active in the present and to impact her community in a positive way, as she contributes to finding the serial killer.      ',nonspam

(Not that I havent read and enjoyed both those authors books).

Nice characterizations; both the protagonist and her mother are appealing.      ',nonspam
' A104Y042UJ1ERG	0844202290	July 31, 2001	14	16	1.0	Try almost anything else	 I have tried and tried to use this set but have to force myself to work with it.  I would have returned it as soon as I opened it if I could have ..., not only because the course is terrible but also because the binding on the book started falling apart right away.  Unfortunately, somehow the corner of the book got wet so I was stuck. The only positive thing I can say about this book/tape set is that is does force you to "interact" by listening to dialogues/monologues to get answers to questions posed in the book.  It also encourages active learning by having you listen to the tape to fill out such things as a lottery ticket or figure out how much you would owe for a parking ticket printed in the book.  These are nice touches and introduce you to contemporary French culture. But these highlights are not nearly enough to compensate for the lack of basic information.  With little to no explanation of grammar or such basics as (translated!) vocabulary lists, the user is expected to move quickly from a few simple greetings to hearing and supposedly being able to decipher long monologues.  I could only have done this with previous French training.  I constantly feel overwhelmed, and even the slices of culture I mentioned above are made difficult by lack of information.  For example, one is never told that the French would use a comma in denoting a price in figures, such as 08,00 for 8 francs, zero. (This refers to the parking ticket I mentioned; I really dont know if other French notations of price would be like that -- which gives you an example of how much you have to simply guess/deduce). In America, we use one period for such a denotation (e.g., $8.00, and wed have a dollar sign.)  It made things hard to figure out.   In short, much too much to have to have to figure out for yourself: few grammar, syntax, or punctuation rules are offered.  You even get little translated French; a long dialogue is only "translated" by a series of matching questions following the dialogue, which only cover selected phrases from the dialogue.  The author took the "Teach Yourself" title very seriously, indeed, but how can you teach yourself with almost no information?      ',nonspam

Greeleys female characters are almost universally beautiful (goes without saying), strong of character, and usually very successful, but Nuala was just a bit beyond the pale for perfection for me.  Really, she was described in such unrelentingly rapturous terms I couldnt get beyond it.  How about some praise for our hero Dermot?   Oh, well, probably just jealous.  Call it sour grapes!

All the protagonist seems to do is whine and complain about the other characters -- that is, when shes not launching into long digressions.  The latter are, perhaps, meant to be informative about dogdom and humorous, but in this book Hollys usual digressive monologues left me cold.  Try some of the other books in the series instead.

' A104Y042UJ1ERG	0553279289	February 12, 2001	32	52	2.0	Good, but with serious reservations	 I must speak a dissenting voice to all the glowing reviews of this book.  Mowat is, no doubt, an excellent naturalist, and many of the adventures described in the book are very entertaining.  However, I am very disturbed that, although the author is ready to defend HIS pets with his shotgun against other animals, he pretty much gave his own animals not just free rein but also encouragement to kill the pets of others.  Mutt the dog is deliberately set on a womans cats, and the "secret cemetery" of neighborhood cats filled by his pet owl is described with almost pride. Also disturbing to me is the authors attitude toward women.  Any complaining woman is described as "spinsterish."  The "Cat Lady" whose cats the author set his dog on to attack and kill was described as harboring "yearning hope" for a male intruder to come and presumably do things to her that I dont want to refer to in a review that children may read -- the implication is pretty strong, with a reference also to the Sabine women. I may get flamed for this review, but I feel that these are very poor attitudes to be subtly or unsubtly conveying to children.  I find it very unfortunate because I endorse the authors work as a naturalist.      ',nonspam
' A104Y042UJ1ERG	014000033X	October 8, 2000	4	6	3.0	The Unsuppressing of Anna	 Story of young woman who is given a measure of financial independence by her oppressive father, and how she gradually reaches for some small measure of autonomy.  The "Five Towns" are the authors fictionalized version of the corresponding cities of the region in England where the famous potteries & glaziers are. Frequently, reviewers note the Methodism in this novel -- it does give a look at the everyday lives of Methodism when it was much more controversial (!) than it is today, if it ever was particularly revolutionary in America. I was more struck by the personal circumstances of Annas plight than her religious questionings, although the latter are definitely imposed on her character by the author. An interesting attempt by a male author to describe a woman suppressed by her domineering father, by strict moral and religious conventions, and by her own personality.      ',nonspam

' A104Y042UJ1ERG	0460876538	April 26, 2000	8	11	3.0	Anna of the Five Towns--Bennetts First "Serious" Novel	 Described by the prolific author as "my serious novel," _Anna_ is the story of a young womans struggles to free herself from the oppression of her domineering father.  The title character is given a  chance to live undreamed-of experiences when she inherits a fortune in  properties and business ventures on her 21st birthday.  Simultaneously, she  finds herself the declared object of affection of one of the towns most  desirable men.  As her story unfolds, she is attracted to another man, more  vulnerable, and must try to resolve many different demands on her sense of  duty and her emotions. Set in the early 1900s, Bennett succeeds in  evoking a strong sense of place with his fictionalized Five Towns of the  Staffordshire Potteries.  Critics have praised his full description of  Methodism and Methodist church life of the time, as well.  Bennett conveys  sympathy for his protagonist and portrays the limitations placed on her for  her gender without falling into condescension, concluding, "She had  sucked in with her mothers milk the profound truth that a womans life is  always a renunciation, greater or less." Annas attempts to expand  herself spiritually and personally, and to gain a sense of personal  efficacy, make for an interesting read.  However, Bennett violates  flagrantly the old writers adage, "Show not tell," as when we  are told repeatedly Annas father is a miser and a tyrant long before we  see him saying or doing anything miserly or tyrannical.  Further, anyone  looking for an intensely psychological novel with thoughts portrayed as  stream of consciousness should be aware that Bennetts style descends from  a Realist tradition.

The book gives you a great roadmap to Certification--showing you (with almost perfect accuracy) whats on the exam and giving you just enough information to properly prepare. Dont use this book to learn VB.Net--thats not what its for. But use it, in conjunction with a good study group (such as one of mine) and an exam simulator such as Transcender, to understand the breadth of knowledge required to pass the exam. The book breaks the major objectives of the exam into sections that it then deals with chapter by chapter. The authors knowledge is obvious--and what I really liked about the book is that he doesnt waste a lot of time trying to impress you with hard to follow code examples.  The code examples, for the most part, are short and sweet---and he follows these up with multiple Step-By-Step exercises interspersed throughout the chapter, and several follow up exercises to complete on your own. In addition, each chapter has a Self Test section that has some excellent exam type questions to further test your knowledge.

' A104Z3S8I1EA7E	B000153MWW	February 3, 2004	15	19	1.0	Sorry, not quite ready for prime time...	 The short story---I returned the watch 3 days after receiving it. Now heres the long versino. Originally, this watch had been on my Christmas list, and so it was with great anticipation when it finally showed up at my door on January 19th.  I opened the box, followed the directions and immediately signed up for the $59 MSN Direct Annual subscription (mistake #1). Within about 20 minutes, I had my MSN channels setup, and I was receiving signals and the watch was working fine. Setup was quick and easy. I waited until the next morning, after letting the watch charge overnight, to try and get it on my wrist---much as I tried, the watch was just too clunky to fit suitably on my wrist. Now when I ordered it, I realized the watch wasnt going to be a fashionable one---but at this point, its clunkiness really bothered me and made me doubt my purchase. It was just either too loose or too tight. Second problem. I follow a group of about 20 fairly large size companies on the NYSE and NASDAQ. Only 3 of them were available on the Stock channel of MSN Direct. And there seemed to be no rhyme or reason. 2 mid sized companies and one small company were all I could add to my Stock Watch list--leaving me 17 short. Third problem. I realized I wasnt getting any Sports information displayed on the watch. Guess what? The Sports Channel is coming soon... For nearly $200, plus a $59 annual subscription to MSN Direct, I expected to be able to get up to the minute Stock reports and Sports in addition to the News and Weather channels. Unfortunately, I couldnt, and so I returned the watch. Amazon refunded my money yesterday (minus the shipping charges since the return was my fault).  Ive been trying to get Microsoft to refund my $59 with less success.

Alex Callinicos presents argument from the "eat your cake and have it too" crowd.  While critical of neo-Liberals, he argues from the same wrong premise, the notion that you can tie the hands of the producers of the world without throttling production.  His chief complaint is not that Capitalism doesnt produce, nor that Capitalism doesnt improve the standard of living for everyone.  Rather, Capitalism improves the lives of the poor less than it improves the lives of the rich.    This only makes sense if you think that theres another way to go.  Callinicos cannot, and despite attempts, does not, make this case.  No one can.  With each turn of the page, I cannot help shouting, within the confines of my own critical mind, "but Capitalism is the best (and only) way to do it!"

I bought one to leave in the bands practice room (why not? the price is right!), so I could keep my Crate MX50B at home, hoping this generic 60-watter would hold its own against a guitar amp & drums.  Nope.  Not quite.  This is a fine practice amp, but side-by-side against my main amp, Id subjectively rate the power around half the Crates 50 watts.  So the Crate will go on the road, and this unit will be my practice unit for home.  Which is fine, since the low end rolls off early (even with the Bass setting at 10, the lows just arent there), it wont shake the walls (or bother the neighbors so much).  On the other hand, though the manual and face of the amp (which arrived with the "AXL" brandname/logo on it) call it a Bass Amp, Musicians Friend is right to market it for keyboards too - the highs and mids are sharp (a tweeter in a bass amp?  Heh.) and theres lots of EQ-ing options.  All-in-all, if youre not expecting what the competition calls 60 watts, and dont need a lot of low-end rumble, this is a steal of a practice or keyboard amp for the (sale) price.      ',nonspam

I suppose its clich , but, "I really wanted to like this film!"  A disappointment from start to finish. Too few meaningful moments separated by too much space and time. Little humor, charisma, even angst & edginess was in short supply. Sparse sets dont quite reach minimalist (minimalism would have been more forgivable).  For example, why have customer background noises (but no other customers)?  Running themes (e.g. cousins/siblings, self-conscious envy and nervous graciousness, vertical camera shots onto the tables) with no meaning.    If youre hoping for an insightful film, a good bit of humor, or a few really shining moments for one or more of your favorite actors, I suspect youll feel as let down as I did.

OK, thats a vinyl reference (and how much better the graphics for this release are in 12" format ... envy me, you youngsters!).  Theres no real "sides" to a CD, but youll feel the difference right away when "Everybody Loves You" plays.  Break-all-the-rules chording, beautiful session work from his hired band, happiness and hope in lyrical, melodic optimism.   While "Take Your Time" might be disposable, "Days" is a thoughtful, beautiful piece. But "Song of Seven," the title track, is the one for which you want this recording.  This is sweeping, dancing, tears-in-your-eyes music to rival any other Jon solo work.  All of Jons work takes a (very) open mind, and in this case, we have his infant child baby-talking in the background while one of the kids recites simple arithmetic for the fade-out.  But what happens before then is glorious.  A song in several parts, with drama (!) and sincerity, with Jons wide, sweeping lyrics, always open to interpretation, anything but mundane. Its this climax which puts Song of Seven properly in the category of Yes Music.      ',nonspam

For inspiration, motivation, and outright fun, its hard to beat Heart Of A Pagan by Dr. Andrew Bernstein. If youre looking for a good basketball story, its in there.  The soul of a champion?  Meet Swoop, the self-made conqueror of the b-ball court.  Overcoming obstacles?  Youll find a couple of the best role models in contemporary literature.  And Heart Of A Pagan is perhaps the best advocate of the unity of the mental and the physical, of the Greek ideal of a healthy mind and a healthy body. But what makes this book unique is the strength with which it delivers the message that the proper object of reverence is Man at his highest and best.  The characters of Swoop and Diggs in Heart Of A Pagan stand as reminders of our own highest aspirations.  Not since discovering Howard Roark in Ayn Rands The Fountainhead (highly recommended!) have I felt so strongly that too-rare reaction: a combination of joy and immediacy, that I want to be and can be, have been and will be, a hero; just like them.

Better than most Yes albums (though not quite a Close To The Edge or Going For The One).  Recommended. The title track is simple, but grand.  Spirit Of Survival couldve been an ABWH track (for better or worse)!  Give Love Each Day is worth the price of the disk alone.  Can You Imagine is too short, just a haunting piece, but arent we glad to hear Chris singing lead again?  Its worth it!  Dont Go and We Agree are perhaps too clearly pop-song-ish, so enjoy them as such: light fare for Yes fans.  Dreamtime attempts the grand scale again, but In The Presence Of... succeeds more fully. This album reminded me of growing up with Yes in several ways - notably, this is an album which is not digested in one sitting.  Many of us couldnt handle Tales on a first listen either (which explains the initial critics reaction - how many times do you suppose they heard it before panning it?).  Of course, within a month, I found Tales indispensable to life!  Same pattern with Relayer, and certain tracks from other Yes masterpieces. The best Yes, like much of the best classical music, requires repeated listening to be integrated, and appreciated. Thats why I have to respectfully wonder if Kirk (one star) has given the album time enough (he gave it one week?!?).   Magnification certainly falls in this catagory - which is why I believe itll hold up with the Classics.  Open Your Eyes had a little punch - but no staying power.  The Ladder added more Andersonness, more benevolence, and was still punchy but ran much deeper.  Magnification has even a little more depth - and Im happy the band is moving in this direction!   Incidentally, Rick Wakeman, a phenomenal talent, was none-the-less never a band guy, generally keeping a session musician attitude.  I preferred Patrick Moraz, Jeff Downes, even Tony Kaye and Igor Khoroshevs willingness to be IN Yes, composing with the band.  Would love to see the orchestral approach of this album expanded, but keep (tour keyboardist) Tom Brislin around, and lets see what he can do!      ',nonspam

' A10587XDOY3OR0	B000003RUV	December 13, 2005	1	3	5.0	Out of left field	 Id never heard of Faust before a few months ago. Id purchased a Flaming Lips compilation that featured "Its a Bit of a Pain" as one of the songs, and decided to buy the parent album. Based on the sound of the song, I was guessing it was made in the last few years. It sounded very modern. But, no. It was made in 1973? Thats crazy. So were the rest of the songs on the album: a weird mix of synth-punk, pop, and rolling, ambient tunes. What makes it stand out from the electronic/synth experimentation of its day is its amazingly mature, spare use of the computer. The synth elements arent wielded in a "gee whiz" showcase manner, they just blend in with the traditional instruments (guitar, drums) to create a whole greater than the sum of its parts. True, there are some points where a song will degrade into shrill, sample showcase, but on the whole the sound is very modern. Subtle things, like the vocal shifting on "Its a Bit of a Pain" stand out to me as a precient technique for 1973. The melodies are all quite capable, too. Even little throwaway bridges in their longer songs are memorable. I can see why they never hit the bigtime, though. While certain songs are radio friendly, they refused to bury their apparent love of free-form, angular, reptitive sound experimentation. I dont see a lot of people listening to "Krautrock" from beginning to end. Its just too unfamiliar.  Thats their loss. Its just my cup of tea.      ',spam
' A10587XDOY3OR0	1576753018	March 7, 2005	27	38	3.0	Confessions of a marginal middle-man	 Its odd that Perkins points out several times in the book that what hes describing is not a consipracy theory, but something something even more odious and concealed. His claims - that the CIA, NSA, and a handful of powerful families are colluding to create a global empire - are hard to frame as anything much different from conspiracy. If theyre not conspiracy, what are they? Policy? Theyre supposed to be secret plans. Perkins book certainly has its merits. It earnestly attempts to focus attention on the truly shady things that the US government and certain corporations have done, and how these actions are often ignored by the popular press. Hes clearly been witness to events and policies that he found repugnant. He doesnt attempt to paint himself as being a laudable person, but rather a typical guy who rationalizes bad things and tries to get by. I didnt get the impression that the book was so much about him as it was the issues (though his timeline at the end seemed unnecessary). I did question his self-assessment of his relative importance (and that of his employers) in the whole scheme of things. To hear him speak, one would assume that the world is a very simple system that spins on US "corporatocracy." He was essentially a salesman who lied to get contracts, though he would have you believe that he was part of an NSA/CIA master plan at all times, which just seems unwieldy and overstated to me. Perkins specific claims make sense. I can buy that the US government had a hand in attempting to control foreign governments, waged unwarranted wars, and benefited those in control. I can buy that corporations use government influence to snare lucrative contracts, pollute environments they operate in, pay people as little as they have to, and distort the truth during sales pitches. Its no revelation that there is corruption in governments around the world, and that their policies arent so altruistic towards their disenfranchised populace. In short, I have no contention with the depiction of people as being self-serving and greedy, and acting on those impulses in immoral ways. Where I cant get in line with Perkins are in the sweeping generalizations he draws from these points, the premises underlying much of his economic and societal arguments, and the overriding importance of these particular issues. Theres a common thread that runs through the book which identifies capitalism as slavery, consumer spending as destructive gluttony, and the actions of all US corporations and government as therefore being sinister subterfuge to spread both. Now, there are probably a lot of people who do agree with these depictions, so the book is doing well. Theres a very black and white philosophy that seems to sprout up in many similar camps which equates everything done for profit as intrinsically evil. Its a sort of "throw the baby out with the bath water" type of mentality that refuses to allow for any benefits from corporations. If someone is making a lot more money than someone else, the whole system is obviously there only to serve that wealthy person.  Its a categorical dismissal of a system that is much more diverse and complex than such arguments imply. Perkins expresses an obvious fondness for living close to the land, and the people of the world who subsist on centuries-old methods of survival. He would prefer us all to live in very small local economies, stop the advancement of Western technology, and become more spirtitual (in some vague way). Im certainly not knocking such societies, but I dont see how theyre the only acceptable way to operate, or why "modern" systems of society are some sort of anathema of humankind. It boils down to an argument of socialism (or friendly anarchy) against capitalism, which is too large to address in my capsule review. It assumes that greed and injustice never existed until the advent of corporations, and that all bad things flow forth from them (mass starvation, disease, war). Its also an age old argument which assumes all wealth is an innate property of the environment, and not something that is created via work, organization, and processing. It doesnt effectively evaluate why poor countries are poor, and were before the United States ever existed. By his own admission (and the strength of his arguments), Perkins isnt an economist.  In the end, Perkins seems mostly to be a man trying to alleviate a guilty conscience, with an exagerrated view of the evils hes experienced, much like the self-loathing and aggrandisement of someone with depression. Who can blame him? If I worked in an all-you-can-eat buffet for 30 years, Id probably think that everyone was a glutton. If I were a cop, Id see everyone as deceptive and destructive. Our reality is shaped by our unique experiences, and Perkins werent so rosy. His heart is in the right place, even if his evaluations and solutions arent so accurate or utilitarian. I did enjoy reading the book. ',nonspam
' A10587XDOY3OR0	0262731622	December 9, 2004	24	25	5.0	The best kept secret	 News flash: there is no such thing as free will. I notice that this fact really irritates a lot of the reviewers here, which makes a good deal of sense. If we accept that there is no free will, we feel our own glory diminished, much as some feel when contemplating the idea that there is no afterlife. A lot of the arguments in favor of free will start with unfounded assumptions that there "must be" some form of free will, because that is the only possible explanation for order in the Universe. Order is really just a manifestation of the laws of physics, and doesnt need intelligent intervention, thank you. When a drop of water freezes into an exquisite snowflake, there is no sentience that guides it. It simply follows the path of least resistance. So too is life, and by extension, intelligence. We feel a bias towards free will because our very sense of self is derived from the ingrained feeling that our thoughts precede our actions. Oh, but do they? As the book rehashes, Libet was one of the first to test this idea emprically, and found that the sequence of electrical events in the brain that accompanied actions always began a noticeable amount of time before the conscious awareness of initiating an action. In the big picture, the vast majority of our actions are mediated by subconscious output, with a trickle of actions being refined by conscious stimuli when we have no experience with a particular situation. It is this subconscious co-opting of thought that enables us to ride a bike, walk, talk, and so on, without the need to consciously consider the steps involved. We take this for granted, but, for example, victims of stroke often find that certain actions they could once do without thinking require considerable attention if not handled automatically. We discount the idea that our actions are mainly subconscious because of the very fact that we dont consciously think about them. That there is no free will is also an elegant explanation for the obvious lack of free will that we can witness in ourselves and others every day. How often do addicts of all kinds (food, drugs, gambling) explain that they cannot control their actions? Or what about spouses who cheat, drawn up in the "heat of the moment"? The temporary insanity plea? Tourettes syndrome? Obsessive-compulsive actions? Our own nightly dream worlds? People are willing to accept that they are not in control of many aspects of their behavior, but fail to make the obvious leap that they are indeed not in control of any of it. Having done something that they did not want to do, people then expose another aspect of the brains process of illusory control by rationalizing their actions ("Another beer wont kill me","my spouse drove me to cheating","biting my fingernails kills the time"). This is the brain tipping its hand to the cards its playing. When we see this in an extreme form, we call it a pathology (alcoholism, OCD). When we experience it in more mundane ways, we call it our thought process. The book spends a lot of time on social aspects of will as well. Were much more likely to do certain things in groups, as we surrender some of our control to that of the group. An obvious example of this are religious ceremonies. People can go into trancelike, convulsive states when they are "slain in the spirit" of God, which they attribute to outside agencies. No one ever questions, however, why one is never visited by God while shopping at Radio Shack. All that said, the illusion of will has a purpose. It may be an illusion, but its still an effective and convincing one. While we may not really have free will, we still experience it all the same, and there is no reason that we should behave any differently knowing this. Beyond a dimunition of our sense of selves that accompanies the loss of will, I think that another reflexive disgust people feel about the concept stems from the percieved lack of responsibility that it implies. If Im not in control, why blame me for what I do? It doesnt really work that way, however. Free will or no, social pressures will still work to modify behavior in individuals. Indeed, our existing penal system works as it does because it shapes the development of our subconscious minds. More simply, we dont even have the free will to act as if we have no free will. So after all this, the issue is moot. It doesnt matter how we work, just that we do. Perhaps the most useful application of this knowledge will be in shaping our approach to altering bad behaviors. Knowing that we have no will, we can predict our more addictive and reflexive behaviors more accurately. Practial applications would be avoiding situations in which we might cave in to temptations. By taking action before we lose our apparent will, we co-opt the problems associated with it, and those insights are easily worth the price of this book.      ',spam

Sopthware is certainly a masterful disc, but is that all people want from thier bands: more of the same? What if the Beatles had made Sgt Peppers four times over? It gets old. I also sense unease with the prospect of Jason Lytle writing "happy" songs. Is he not allowed to be happy? Just because its not dark doesnt mean its instantly blaze and mainstream. Your disconnect more likely means that youre depressed. I for one applaud this new effort from one of our best bands going. The songwriting is solid, and I would argue that the last two songs are the most grand and touching that theyve ever made, and my favorites from their entire catalog. For those whove never spun a Grandaddy CD, this is as good a disc as any to start with. Id say you could best describe them as a rock band with a dash of country, low-fi synth, and one of the more unique, memorable vocalists nowadays. They remind me most of The Flaming Lips, and Pet Sounds-eque Brian Wilson. Theyre an indie rock band without the anger or self-importance. Find another band like that.       ',spam

Even if you didnt know about the unfortunate details of his life (and death), his music more than tells the story. It can be said that his music was beautiful, original, melodic, and classic, but I think that the most remarkable thing about it is the depth of personal, childlike emotion he filled it with. Nick Drakes voice had an uncanny ability to translate directly from his mood to your ears. At the risk of being voted down, Ill say that his music is not for everyone. Indeed, its probably not for the majority of people. His songs were crafted with a minimum of force and flair, and dont grab your attention if youre not listening. Theyre muted, floating, subtle compositions that dont play well in a public setting. Theyre also progressively depressing, with Pink Moon as the capstone on a lonely life. Because of this, I find it hard to listen to his music today. I found Nick Drake when I was at a very similar place in life, and the music sounded as if it were a soundtrack to my experience. It was one of the few things I had that I could relate to, and it gave me a friend to commiserate with. Because of this, it frightens me to encounter again, having climbed out of that hole. Music is the truest expression of emotion, to me, and as such it has the ability to tune you to its frequency. Still, you listen for what you feel, and Nicks songs werent all sombre and lost. Five Leaves Left strikes me as his most upbeat, accessible albumn, and features several of his best songs, appropriate for any mood. Will you like his music? Give it a go.      ',spam
' A10587XDOY3OR0	B0000ADXEC	September 1, 2004	3	3	5.0	Wow.	 This is just an incredible album. Ive always liked Ween, and have been buying their records since The Pod. Their albums have always had a few songs that revealed the potential they had as song writers, but they werent usually "serious" musical compositions. They were more humorous than emotionally moving, and were enjoyable in their own right. They were good, but their tone made them inaccessible to those who werent into the boognish. Quebec is a significant departure, sounding more like Pink Floyd, The Doves, and the Beatles than classic Ween. Im sure this will alienate those who are mired in their musical past, but should also impress a great deal of new listeners. One of the greatest qualities of this album is the range of styles they employ. A good rock band that makes only rock can become stale and musically incestuous, as there are only so many rock structures floating around in their heads. Theyre bound to revisit themes more than once, and the whole collection begins to sound uninspired. Ween have an impressive ability to float between entirely different genres, and do so very fluently. It also doesnt sound like they labored to encompass the styles, it sounds like the styles are just many faces of their innate musical minds. Whether theyre doing ragtime or rock, they do so in a signature way that can make you appreciate any structure (I dislike country, but I love 10 Golden Country Greats). In this way, theyre very Beatle-esque. In short, theyre music for modern music lovers of all types. Their more recent songwriting ability reminds me of Badly Drawn Boy, another musician that seems to intuitively understand music in general. My personal favorites from this disc so far: -Chocolate Town (in my head as I write this) -Tried and True -Transdermal Celebration -Captain  You really cant go wrong buying this disc, Ween fan or no.

' A10587XDOY3OR0	1572307471	February 2, 2004	7	9	5.0	Youre a fancy robot.	 Thats the disheartening take away message from this text. As organisms, we dont tend to think much about the mechanisms behind our thoughts, motivations, and actions. We implicitly assume that they all derive from "us." We feel as though we are rational entities with free will, who evaluate our environments and choose actions that will make us happy. Its a fluid and convincing process that supports itself, hence the unquestioning belief we have in our autonomy. But what makes us tick? All those wet parts in our head obviously have something to with it. Weve all seen people whose mechanics have failed them, victims of Alzheimers or stroke or schizophrenia. Theyre not so volitional or rational. Or what about animals? Its easier to believe that mice or ants are creatues of instinct, that they follow simple rules and dont reflect on themselves. Well, this book is one of many to illustrate that we too are mindless creatures of instinct. This makes sense if you think about it from an engineering standpoint. How could you ever devise a system that had free will? The very idea is at odds with the laws of physics, as it implies some level of operation above nature (i.e. supernatural, nondeterministic). Centuries ago, this was considered proof of the soul, and existance on a deeper plane ("I think, therefore I am."). Our behavior looks too complex to us to be the result of algorithms operating on cumulative experience, but thats exactly what it is. WE are essentially the result of unconscious processes that evaluate our environment and determine the best actions, based on the results of prior associations, to achieve evolutionary ends (procreation, ultimately, and survival, immediately). What we experience as our mind is the result of a part of the brain that claims authorship of actions already initiated at a subconscious level. Its a confabulation engine that makes coherent stories about why we chose to do things, what we intended to do, and what were planning to do. Its a process that works seemingly backward. In this regard, we come to know ourselves much as others do, by observing ourselves. Given our more intimate relationship with our own brains, however, we have a priveleged perspective (though not in all areas, as the market for psychoanalysts can attest)). This, to me, was the most fascinating angle of the book. The "dynamics" aspect of the book is an attempt to explain the way the brain creates dynamic behavior by utilizing a collection of attractors, or default states, which interact with each other to determine an ultimate single state. Because the attractors are operating on the edge of stability, mild perterbations in the environment can produce dramatic shifts in the strengths of the various attractors, and affect the eventual output of the system. Much like a weather pattern, this results in broadly predictable trends, but transiently unpredictable behavior. I have a feeling this theoretical framework is based mostly on conjecture, but it seems a productive line of thought. Overall, a very interesting read which will forever prejudice your understading of yourself, and with many social and legal ramifications that await future argument (people will still argue in favor of free will, I imagine, despite all evidence to the contrary).

I think that whats bothering a lot of people about this album is its unwavering cheesiness compared to his prior, more subtle compositions. Its bouncy, hopelessly happy, and laced with sometimes sappy lyrics. Have You Fed the Fish is Paul McCartney compared to the previous (Bewilderbeast) Lohn Lennon album. This makes it feel less "cool" to be sure. Any album that posits "Woman, Ill make you a girl" has complicitly relinquished its right to be edgy. Its kind of a guilty pleasure in this way, and I dont play it at parties. That said, the thing you have to love about Damon Gough is his total inability to produce bad melodies. This guys head must be incessantly producing melody. Hes the Mozart of pop. They just oooze from him. Im in awe. Being the type of person I am, they stick in my mind for days, and I love them.

According to Amazon, this album is appreciated by people who like The Flaming Lips, Wilco, and the Shins. Beyond this, Amazon kept dropping it in my "Boy, youll like this!" web page.  So anyway, Im thinking, "cool, some inspired, mellow tunes to add to my collection." Id downloaded "NYC" and really liked it. Everything looked good. After enough exposure, I finally caved in and bought it (...in a big end display at Best Buy, which should have been a sign). It look little time to appreciate that "NYC" is in no way representative of the tone of the album. Its much more like the White Stripes or The Strokes than the previously mentioned bands. Its a lot of high-energy guitar and fuzzed, shouting vocals. Thats not a critique of the album. If you like that kind of music, its probably pretty good. Ive just had enough loud, angry people in my life that I dont need to buy a record of it. I appreciate milder stuff, which is what I was hoping for. Something like The Shins or even Radiohead (yeah, they have some angry music, but its more tempered and musical). There *are* a few poplike songs on the disc (track 1,3,10). So thats really about it. Just a warning to those who arent looking for strutting, harsh rock. To those who do, rock on!      ',nonspam

I think the best way to relate to a reviewers viewpoint is to know what else they like. To triangulate my location, I like The Flaming Lips, the Shins, Badly Drawn Boy, Nick Drake, Belle and Sebastian, Wilco, and Radiohead. None of those bands have ever made a bad album, and the same applies to Grandaddy. The first Grandaddy album I bought was The Sophtware Slump, which took a while to grow on me, but when it did, it stuck fast. I rotated it through my collection regularly. A year passed, and I needed something new, so I bought this (and the new album) in a spending fit. Again, it took a little while to grow on me, but within a week, I found myself mumbling "I took your advice...", "drink beer, out in the country..." along with floating off in mindless surrender to the instrumental title track. Its pleasant and personal, and I cant wait until my new Dolby reciever comes in so I can listen to it fully.      ',spam

A lot of bluesy jangling that meanders along with some calm vocal accompaniment, then an energetic freak out with some gravelly shouting, then back again, over and over. It all hangs together, and its not *bad*, but it doesnt really stand out. The melodies are capable, but nothing exceptional. The vocals sound like something from a Subway commercial. Again, competent, but so what? They do present you with a full sound, and a lot of details, but its like they did it just so I could say that. None of the touches really accents anything. idk. I bought this disc because Amazon kept pushing it on me. I want to like it, but maybe its just like a girl thats pretty and all, but doesnt click with me.

Of course, I could just be getting older, and less appreciative of this kind of music, but I dont find myself playing this disc all that much.

Its a significant departure, musically, from previous Lips albums. Its hard for me to describe this disc. Obvious observations would be: electronica, psychedelia, pop, lighthearted, melodic. The music and accompanying vocals merge together gracefully and poignantly, with basslines and pleading, soothing vocal strains that insituate themselves into your brain. Wayne Coyne is a gentle spirit in an arena of otherwise swaggering, aloof artists. You feel like he cares deeply about things, and isnt concerned about coming off cool. That quality alone gets my attention. It makes the disc like a friend, whos there to skip stones with you and enjoy the breeze. Its uplifting and personal, and my favorite Lips album to date. For those whove never heard them, Id compare the overall feel of this music to something like Kid A (if Thom Yorke were happy), or maybe a more subtle and modern Deee Lite. Anyway, Id recommend buying it and listening to it at least several times, and I dont recommend a lot of stuff.      ',spam

Anyway, I figured Id really like this album, so I got it. Now, if this disc sounds like anything, it sounds like a thinly veiled Travis. Its *eerie* how similar they are. Thats great if you love Travis (and The Man Who *was* pretty good). This music just lacks something, though, and its hard to define. For one, Im not real impressed with their melodies. The notes they choose in sucession. An example of a great melody disc is Badly Drawn Boy. Take away the words, and youve still got a great CD. This is a lyrical CD. The words just keep coming at you in a consistant, forgettable delivery. The sound is lazy and muted, which I guess they wanted. They sound like theyre trying to be sad. If youre like me, you also appreciate a certain honesty and earnestness in your music. Something that sounds genuine and approachable. Turin sounds like they decided to become musicians because they could, but not because they really wanted to. Now, Im exaggerating for the sake of time, but it just feels uninspired. Like a computer program that analyzed serious, brooding brit-folk and cranked out an albumn. Its there, I guess. Its ok. It just feels unnecessary. It doesnt *move* me. I wish Id liked this album. I spent good money on it, and its so hard to find good ones. The last couple songs are ok, if nothing else. Just kind of dissapointing.      ',nonspam
' A10587XDOY3OR0	B00004Z42C	January 17, 2002	6	6	5.0	Why is this band so ignored?	 Im really picky about the music I listen to. I want it to be *good* and inspired. I want the musicians to pay attention to the sounds they produce. I want good melodies and a comfortable vocalist. I want it all to be intentional and genuine. Typically, this means Im usually nonplussed with most of the stuff I hear. Radiohead, for example, is all of the above. Wonderful. Coldplay is pretty good, Travis is ok, and Belle and Sebastian are an institution. The Doves deliver on these demands. Lost Souls has at least 6 great tracks, and several good ones, which is more than I usually expect. The music is wistful and powerful. The sounds are all lovingly tweaked and mixed. Certain tracks are wonderfully hypnotic. And therere no bands that really compare to them, in my opinion. Certainly not as well. If you get this album and dont like it, I feel sorry for you.

The question is not whether there are wizards and metaphysical possibilities within the human spirit, the question is when they will be revealed. The popularity of these is based on a human desire for fun, for joy, for an otherworldliness, and of course for the oppurtunity inherent in the goodness of man to do battle with evil.

For anyone who has had a spiritual experience, the title song and rest of the album truly reflect a desire for a spiritual concsiouness in a material world. "Like a Prayer, Ill Take You There, Its like A Dream to Me."  What person in this world full of selfishness and ego, doesnt wish to go there, where prayers go. The beauty and truth in the song is the path of the singer. At first she says yes, than no, no more, "I have no choice," Than of course, I feel like dancing, where the seeker  and sought are one. The dance after a successful journey is truly a moment of joy, as beautifully expressed by the choir.   As for the name, Madonnas name is surely a connection to a heavenly entity. None less than the Buddha, before he adopted his life of ascetism, enjoyed every pleasure of the physical world, including sex(See Siddharrtha). He came to see their emptiness. While our songstress may not exactly rise to the greatness of her namesake, (or that of the Buddha), she surely has a spark of her soul. What we are witnessing is the journey of mankind form a low, mundane, physical conscious, to a place where the Light of the world will be revealed.

From the inundation of flower petals to the mirrored court(and Branaghs dyed hair), this is over the top. While acting, or really just making speeches, Branagh never forgets he is a movie star, and doesnt become the character. Its a different take on Hamlet, without the emotional pain and with a lot of bile. The developement of the character does not really make sense. The portrayal of Gertrude(Julie Christie) is also problematic.         For its good points, Derek Joacobi is excellent as Cladius, and the portayal of Hamlets relationship with Ophelia and Polonius was revalatory. Also I very muched enjoyed the scene with the the first player(Charleton Heston) and the passages regarding Hecuba (which are left out of the Olivier version).

Even though many may disagree, I still love the Ethan Hawke Hamlet and my favorite Ophelia is Julia Stiles(maybe she because she looks like someone I could love, and she expresses modern madness). I do love this version, but it is by no means definative, as each generation will need to express the madness that comes with the responsibilty that the other world gives to mere mortals. As Hamlet says "the plays the thing", but as we know real life intrudes into Hamlets "madness" and it ends tragically for all concerned. All people on a true spiritual journey battling the demons created by the sins of man and woman will identify with Hamlet and hopefully will learn that it is not the "the play" thats the thing, but life itself.

This book opened my eyes to another side of homelessness.

This should be an eye-opener for some of the liberals who blame homelessness on everyone but the homeless.  This book proves otherwise.  It may be an isolated situation, but I have my doubts.    Bravo to Jeannette for overcoming her upbringing to become a contributing member of society and having the courage to finally confront her past through this novel.

This is a book for a reading group because it will elicit so many more questions than there are answers and after youve completed it, believe me, youre going to want to talk about it with someone else whos read it. The construct was terrific and as a result I book 2 more of OBriens books immediately.  While both were good, neither matched the plot, suspense, and tempo of In the Lake of the Woods.  I would recommend this book to anyone, but I especially think Vietnam Vets could really relate. Now, Im off to try Tomcat in Love.  Since OBrien can write the serious scary stuff that only nightmares are made of, I want to see what he can do with humor and love. What a find.  Im so glad I found this book listed in Bas Bleu because I hadnt seen it hyped anywhere else.      ',spam

Although not a complete Lehane fan, based on some of his other novels, I decided to give Mystic River a read before seeing the movie.  I was not disappointed.   This was powerhouse writing at its best.  Its hard to call this simply a good mystery novel when it is so much more.  It contains a complex, penetrating and melancholy plot that delves into some of the moral issues of our day.  It reaches deep into the blackest of hearts and searches out the haunting results of childhood innocence lost.  This book isnt just about child molestation, thugs, crime, mystery, and petty criminals.  Its about evil and innocence, friendship and betrayal, love and guilt. Its about how our childhood experiences mold us into the adults we are, regardless of how hard we might try to fight it. This is a gripping tale and I found myself constantly going back and re-reading several passages to ensure that I fully understood all the plot twists and turns.  Truly it is disturbing and there is ugliness in it, because there is ulgliness in human nature--and that may put off some readers.  However, Mystic River represents a book that is well-written and intelligently plotted with good dialgoue. I would recommend it to anyone who likes crime or mystery novels.      ',nonspam

It attracted me because it was about Mothers and Daughters, and I was missing mine and needed a hidey-hole to forget about my present circumstances--motherless! Although I did not read the first book, I would recommend this book to every girl who has a mother and every mother who has a daughter.  Theres a lot of life, love, misery, and joy between these pages and the traveling pants, while seemingly nonsensical, made this book a delight!  Take a chance, read the book, regardless of your age or gender.  I think youll find youve made a wise decision and the tugs on your heartstrings will help you remember that youre still alive, even if, like some of us, the most important person in the world is no longer available to share it with you!  Thanks Ann Brashares for making my life more bearable at an awful time!      ',nonspam
' A105E427BB6J65	0449907503	September 10, 2002	2	3	3.0	Not As Billed!	 I bought this book on the basis of the title Closing Arguments and the hype "a superb piece of courtroom drama.."  This book is neither.  It has little, if anything to do with action in the courtroom and the "closing arguments" leave more questions than answers. That being said, this book is an amazing look into the pysche of one rather disturbed dysfunctional male, who happens to be an attorney.  However, that is the only thing about his life that is real--nothing else is.  ...  In fact, his own past is somehow mired in the dark side of abuse, betrayal, and destruction.   While his wife, Schelle, tries to help him deal with a past she neither knows nor understands(by dedicating a Vietnam Memorial in their hometown), Marcus chooses another remedy.  He decides to exorcise his demons with the help of his current client, herself a sexually dysfunctional mess.  His plan is to leave his family the "Closing Arguments" and his bloody corpse.  It is the only way that he can see to extricate himself from the lifetime of lies that he has foisted upon his family, himself, and the community. I must say, I was put off by all the sexual exploitation that occurred between Marcus and his client.   It was only after I had completed the book and rethought the plot, that I realized it is indeed a finely crafted novel.  I dont think Id want too many more of these in a row though, its very dark and disturbing.  But, in the final anaylis, its worth the read.  I will try anothr Busch novel before I make any final decisions on whether his writing style is something I want to spend a lot of time on.      ',nonspam

But, if you see the movie without certain expectations, you will truly enjoy a great movie and great acting. Then go sit down and absorb the book on all levels, as it is the movie and so much more.  Youll cry, youll laugh, youll be annoyed, angry, and confused, but youll never be bored. I cant believe that there are some reviewers that absolutely hated this book.

Great characters, nice magical references, but it appears Alice got to a certain page and decided to wrap it up.  No ryhme, no reason.  The plot did not deserve this ending.  Im left feeling very unfulfilled.  Im not even certain of the reason for the name of the book, let alone why one of the better characters is killed off early on and were not ever given a satisfactory reason. And then other characters appear but dont seem to stay around of have any purpose, like Sean Byers. And Betsy running away with Abe????  The pharmacist suddenly discussing everything with his wife.  This isnt the result of magic, but lack of imagination maybe?  None of the actions or character/plotline prepares the reader for the way Alice wraps up a tidy little ending, unfit for the great beginning.  Quite a let down.  Did Alice run out of steam on this one?  I wont give up on Hoffman, but this was not her best effort.      ',nonspam

Russo is an artist when it comes to character development, but the story left me weary when I realized Miles was never going to take full responsibility for his life--sometimes I wanted to shake Miles.  Scenes and interchanges between Miles and those who populated his life were hysterical at times and predictable at others. All in all, a good read, but the ending was a bit contrived, too tidy.  Russo does a good job painting the "regular joe" who takes life as it comes, and doesnt take life by the throat--a fault we all engender at times. I enjoy the way Richard Russo develops his characters and I found myself caring for all of them, not just the "stars", but even the minor characters were well drawn and loveable.  It definitely seemed like a slice of small town America. I would definitely recommend the book and Ill read Russo again.      ',nonspam

Dunne is a good writer, entertaining, and worth reading.  However, there was nothing new in this book.  The man does get around socially and subsequently, he gets his story.  While Dominick Dunne speaks with an honest voice, hes still singing the same old tune.  Maybe Im tired of hearing about OJ?

' A105E427BB6J65	0425184234	August 7, 2002	7	7	5.0	Absorbing!!!  Twisted!!!	 As an avid reader of Nazi-related fiction and nonfiction, I found this book totally captivating.  Little did I know about how far the Nazi regime reached into other countries, cultures, etc.   The writing is so compelling that I had to remind myself that I was reading a fiction crime novel and not a true story. The double track (1941 vs 1990s)storyline is compelling and accomplished seamlessly.  The characters are developed in such a manner that you will despise them, ache for them, or want to kill them yourself.   I cant see how anyone could finish this novel without generating deep feelings towards the characters and their activities. Tautly written, but violent and steamy.  May be too much for the weak of stomach to imagine that human to human interaction can be so heartless and cruel.  For those who cling to historical or personal revenge, grip tight for an engrossing, intellectually wrought rendering that will leave you squirming and reading late into the night. By far, this was one of the better books Ive read this summer.  If you dont mind tension and edgy flawed characters, and how the sins of the past haunt the present, then youll want to pick up a copy of this gem.  Staring human nature in the face can be a terrifying experience, even from a distance, but Wilson has managed to pull it off.  Ill be looking for more of Robert Wilson in the future.  I highly recommend this book.      ',spam

I felt that all of the characters were believable and for the most part likeable. I did have a little bit of a problem getting around the fact that no one but the mother noticed that Katie was pregnant  And, I also question whether, upon waking, a young girl (even an innocent Amish girl) wouldnt have been astounded and curious about where her new infant had gone. I was hoping for more in the court room and found the final settlement a bit trite.  Im too cynical to believe the justice system works this way. All in all, this was a quick and interesting read.  I will buy another Picoult book because I did enjoy the character development and the research that went into this novel.      ',nonspam
' A105E427BB6J65	0385503008	June 14, 2002	1	2	4.0	Deep and Powerful!	 WOW!  This novel hit me on a number of levels.  Griffith knows how to draw the reader in and then POW! deliver the ol one/two sucker punch. Aud is a delightful character--multifaceted and real.  Girffith develops the book in such a way that I can see the cabin surrounded by trees, feel the breeze, and smell the dirt while in the next instance I can feel the grit of New York City, hear the blaring noise, and feel the sun glaring off the asphalt--all within the space of a page.   Although the premise of a hip know-it-all type like Tammy being sucked into a mindless slave may be hard for some to believe, it struck a real nerve with me.  I faltered a little on the way Aud disabled the dirty rotten scoundrel, as details were sketchy, but for such a minor oversight, who cares.... The rest was brilliant! This book, on so many levels, is extemely well written and absorbing.  It touches so many feelings from grief to brutality, yet expounds on each so that you wont feel cheated by any of the characters or emotions that will roil through you as you suck this novel down. Now, I guess Ill have to go back and read some of Giffiths earlier works.  This is one talented lady!      ',nonspam

I know there will likely be a sequel, but even if there isnt one, I appreciate the fact that Frasier did not feel compelled to wrap the ending into a tidy bow.  She didnt need to go off into a romantic ending nor make everything end perfectly.  Instead, she mimics true life. Her storyline was creative and unique.

' A105E427BB6J65	0688177557	March 27, 2002	7	7	5.0	Terrific Read!	 I thoroughly enjoyed Bretts novel, even though the ending left me wondering what would happen next.  I enjoyed the gutsy Ruth and her unforgiving attitude about what her parents had endured.  Sometimes she seemed to go over the top and I would think--"Lighten up!", but the overall effect was necessary for her character.  I loved her Father, who made me laugh and remember my grandparents, also from an East European country, who (although they lived in the states for many years) still pronounced many words in their wacky endearing way. The Hoss character I still cant put to rest. But, it made the novel interesting, even if I dont quite understand why Brett used this device and what were actually supposed to assume he was.  Was he just the imagination of an overwrought angry Jewish woman, determined to relive her parents pain?  Whatever.  Hoss still provided an avenue for Brett to give us another perspective that would otherwise be unavailable to todays writer.  And, in that sense, I applaud Bretts imagination. I did feel Brett cut the ending short, making me think there must be a sequel coming.  But maybe this is just another one of her devices to keep the reader wondering and thinking about the book. There were any number of coincidences in the book that could be seen as too fantastic to believe.  But, even so, this was a really great read!  Very deceptive title, especially for the nonreader.  My husband was very curious because I dont read "romance" novels and he couldnt figure out what kind of book I was reading late into the night! Keep em coming Lily!      ',spam
' A105E427BB6J65	0345422619	March 27, 2002	1	1	4.0	I badly needed this book!	 Paniccia did a great service for any woman that may be thinking of filing a sexual discrimination suit.  Especially, if they already have filed suit and have a lawyer who is not forthcoming about what to expect. There were some areas of interest that I personally have that Paniccia did not cover, but overall this is a worthy read if youre contemplating a lawsuit.  It will prepare you in many ways and this type of preparation is necessary in order to survive a lawsuit of this nature.  No one but a woman who has endured sexual discrimination or retaliation could understand. Whereas Paniccias case was outright and obvious with her "mommydom" memo, there are many women, I believe, who are constantly enduring discrimination only in more oblique/obtuse ways that can easily be covered over or explained away.  This is especially true in todays society where I do not think the court system is favorable to the individual.  Finding a lawyer who is truly dedicated to your cause and remembers that its your case and you lived it is very important to succeeding.  These types of lawyers are few and far betweeen.  What with case loads so high, and the push by firms to take clients that can make big settlements, these cases often dont get the attention they deserve. Maybe if they made the settlements higher, more lawyers would be inclined to take the cases and then maybe there would be less tolerance in the workplace for this type of behavior.  Right now, its still a good ol boy system and as long as it is, theyll make and break the rules as they please!      ',nonspam

Afterall, not every author could blow your socks off on the last page.  Ill even admit that after I finished the book, I went back and reread the first chapter again, picking up on things Id missed before. I definitely feel this book could keep a reading group debating for hours.  And, that is what makes for a great read--something that haunts you, makes you think, even curse, question your sanity, or question the authors sanity.  But anyone who reads this completely through and comes away with a "ho hum" attitude is either brain dead or decieving his/herself.  Youll either love it or hate it, there isnt much room for complacency in this novel. It did remind me a little of the movie Momento in terms of starting at the end and working backwards and finally wondering what actually happened.  Writing in reverse order (from ending to beginning) like Shreve did cannot be easy and for this alone I applaud her. Dont listen to the naysayers.  Give this book a chance.

Janet has the ability to draw characters like few other suspense thriller writers of her genre. I particularly enjoy the fact that they dont have perfect hair or leap over tall buildings in a single bound, but instead they find themselves in ridiculous situations that bring them the humanity and commonality that is so frequently missing in suspense novels. There is none of the perfect chisled characters who are wise beyond belief. But instead, we get Plum, her granny, her sexual desires, her cousin Vinnie, and failed attempts that make for great reading escapes and enjoyable entertainment. Be careful not to read this one in a public place because youll find yourself bursting out loud with laughter and either someone will wrestle it away from you or theyll clear extra space for you.

It was nothing like I expected it to be and yet it was more than I had hoped for. Gourevitch should have a great future ahead of him as a novelist.

I felt that this was a great twisted plot, although at times the characters were a bit thinly drawn--however, who really knows what childhood events can turn one into a raging sociopath?  Certainly there was a lot of thought, and unique devices employed by Margolin in his storyline.  I was really ready to be entertained and escape from the everyday work world and this certainly did it for me, keeping me up two nights in a row so I could find out if I had the killer figured out.

A lot of the writing struck me as a bit over the edge--contrived, and reality was completely lacking in some areas.  That being said, the premise was a great one and the idea was inventive and not overdone.  However, overall, I would have preferred a few more blemishes on the characters and more chill, less thrill and less of a feeling that I was looking at a hyped-up soap-opera.  There were some nice twists and turns, but I was anxious to get to the end, so I could find something more substantial to read. Too much butter on the popcorn, Sandra.

' A105E427BB6J65	0684823438	January 6, 2001	2	2	3.0	A Good First Attempt, but...	 I must be getting too picky, cuz I like my thrillers to be realistic and I like the weaver to complete the picture.  This novel, while a good first attempt is not great.  The characters were a bit too over the top--General Buck Perry, cold blooded killer?  Sarah Petersons rise to the top of her field, but after her first day on the job of protecting the Secretary of State, she spends the rest of the novel solving the kidnapping.  Seems like her boss would have noticed her absence?  The double cross by Grizz was predictable, but added the necessary opportunity for a display of fire power. However, even the shoot-out at the lighthouse, while off to a great start, was disappointing in the end.  And, how about Walter?  How come his snooping for Sarah never gets him in trouble.  He seems to continually tap and peek into places that got his lab friend killed, yet hes allowed to satisfy all of the questions Sarah cant get to on her own.  Finally, the letter at the end did not blend with the story line and appeared too contrived.  Im not sure why it would even be included, unless Steve Samuel wants an easy sequel?  Samuel has some great scenes and some white-finger action in this book, and he shows great promise.  I hope hell not take the easy way out next time.  I prefer my heros and heroines to be a little more down-to-earth and real, not the untouchable glitz that we can get from Hollywood.  Keep trying Steve, youre almost there....      ',nonspam
' A105E427BB6J65	0671867636	January 6, 2001	6	10	2.0	Way Over-Hyped!	 Keppel has a hard time telling this story. In fact, Im not too sure what story hes telling.  Is this a story about Bundy, about the Green River Killer, or about Keppel.  On all fronts, it falls far short, is very fragmented and hard to follow.  Worst of all, it left me unsatisfied--I still dont know anymore about Ted Bundy than when I first started the book.  I would hardly say that Bundy reveals his secrets in this book. I would say instead, that Bundy takes Keppel on a boring self-absorbed ride through his own speculations about getting into the mind of the Green River Killer.  What you do see is Ted Bundy as a bloated pontificator of the worst kind!  Keppel fails to get from Bundy what he promises and as a result I feel the book did not deliver! Save your money, there are better true crime novels about Bundy than this--I hope!      ',nonspam

This particular novel was a delight--sad, funny, poignant, true, and triumphant in every sense.  Dont miss this one, it has something for everyone. Dont be put off because it appears to be a story about a middle-aged woman going through a divorce--its sooo much more.

Gayle Lynds definintely has some talent, but as an avid thriller reader, I found her plot and characters too unbelievable--in fact I felt as though I were reading a cheesy romance writers attempt at murder and mystery.  Everything was just toooooo contrived, from the CIA head, to the Carnivore, to the look-alike cousins, to the clown disguises, to the evil doctor.  For me, this was not a "page-turner" and I only finished it because it was loaned to me by my best friend and I had to find out how Lynds wrapped this all together in the final outcome.  Unfortunately, the ending was also lame.  I believe Gayle will get better with practice and I would recommend this as a good airplane or waiting room read if you want something glitzy that doesnt take much power of concentration.

This was an engrossing tale of the darker side of our judicial system. Regardless who committed the murder, Roger Coleman did not receive a fair and just trial. While we will never know the truth, it seems that many miscarriages of justice occurred throughout this long process and there are many who will atone for Rogers death--the judge, the defense team, the prosecutors, the Governor and his staff, the Appeals Courts, the police and investigators, and the Almighty Supreme Court.  The one aspect of the murder that was never discussed was the motive for the crime, assuming Roger was the murderer?  Well written and worth the read.      ',nonspam
' A105E427BB6J65	0393046974	December 3, 2000	17	22	2.0	Whats all the fuss?	 This book, however well written it may be, left me feeling like I was caught in Dubus fog and standing on his quick sand.  I forced myself through the first half in the hopes of finding something morally enlightening or spiritually uplifting.  I was NOT to be rewarded. This book continued its downward spiral until the very end.  I found all of Andres characters to be stereo-typical, the men--macho and controlling, and the women--weak and helpless.  Even though Kathy had serious issues, and Mrs. Behrani was a product of her culture, these 2 at least attempted to deal with the "ownership" of the home in an honorable way.  Unlike many readers, I did not find Mr. Behrani honorable or noble.  No man that treats women like he did is deserving of respect, regardless of what his cultural teachings may find acceptable.  And, Lester, was the typical bully, hiding behind his badge and feeding his need for excitement through a veneer of helpfullness. Mr. Dubus uses an engaging style and his writing is good, but this book had no redeeming value for me.  Character development was weak for Kathy and Lester.  I felt like I was starting the book somewhere in the middle where I should know why Kathys mother and brother found her a loser and why her husband left her.  The entire experience was not unlike eating cotton candy.  It left me feeling sticky but still hungry.  Now, I have to go find a "meat and potatoes" book.      ',nonspam

I was impressed with Thayers ability to develop so many tightly written characters capable of drawing the reader into their lives and into the action.  Not a wasted word in this crisp WWII Nazi thriller.  The dialogue was tight, the characters well developed and the "hero", Jack Cray while relentless and ruthless is also honorable and noble--not an easy task to wrap into one character and still make him believable. Thayer did an excellent job!  Put this on your "to read" list.      ',nonspam

For those of you who are intrigued by the political machine and the inner workings of Washington D.C., this book will not disappoint.  Baker gives an exhaustive, balanced, and readable account of the actual impeachment process.  It was a bit nauseating to know that partisan politics are more important to our countrys "leaders" than doing the right thing and taking the high road, regardless of the outcome.  It may be time for another political party to arise and its past time for the American people to arise and make their elected officials accountable for their actions.  Very well researched,...

Unlike many authors, DeMille is not a formulaic writer and each book covers a diverse topic requiring intense research.

I grabbed this one hot off the press because of my preference for Baldaccis literary susspense style.   After recognizing Wish You Well was a complete departure from his previous works, I decided to keep an open mind, since it appeared Baldacci has been wanting to try a different genre.  I came away disappointed, however, in what I considered a rather pat, shallow story.  Though the potential was great and the characters worthy of exploration, David falls short, leaving me with a feeling that it will take him additional attempts before he can touch the human spirit via this type of novel.  All of the ingredients were present in the novel--it just didnt go deep enough.  Perhaps David tried to put too many of his ideas into one book and wound up doing only an adequate job.  I wouldnt discourage him from future attempts, as hell undoubtably get better at this type of writing.  In the meantime, I hope he returns to the suspense writing for which hes earned an admirable reputation.      ',nonspam
' A105GWGM7PDAI2	B00008ODBQ	July 10, 2003	2	2	5.0	Great Expansion to a Great Game	 The storyline of WC3:RoC continues with FT, and it continues well.  Illidan, who had been MIA at the end of RoC, returns, with the hope of crushing the Lich King for one of the last demon lords still around after the defeat of Archimonde.  Other returning characters are Tyrande Whisperwind, Furion Stormrage, Prince (Now king) Arthas, Slyvanis Windrunner, and more.  The story is great, and its more intriguing than the one in RoC, and we also get some backstory relating to the original two Warcraft games, which is great.  Its amazing how Blizzard managed to integrate the stories of the three games.  I havent delved into multiplayer much, because one drawback of this game is that everyone is now a Level 1 player to start off, so, as a former Level 5 guy, Im now playing Level 10 RoC players who have become the same level as me, which is intimidating.  A couple of drawbacks are the lack of cinematics (Only two), and the sad absence of an Orc campaign, replaced by a bonus campaign designed to showcase the new advances in the map editor.  While the new advances are neat, nothing can replace good old fashioned orcs.  Also, some of the new multiplayer maps are terrible.  They brought back boats in this game, but the only real benefits to the boats are troop transport.  While there are battleships and frigates, they are really only there to protect the transports.  The addition of boats was actually a more annoying thing, as now there are missions and maps that split everything into islands, and you need to get boats just to get them.  Overall, this game is great, and a worthy addition to any PC game collection.      ',spam
' A105GWGM7PDAI2	B000002JS6	May 6, 2003	1	1	5.0	Great CD Made Better	 This CD is great.  I bought this CD with the belief that AC/DC had only three good songs (Back in Black, You Shook Me All Night Long, and Highway to Hell), but now, after listening to this CD, thats changed.  There are numerable memorable songs, and parts of songs, notably the intro to Hells Bells, such a great intro to a pretty good song.  Others end up having a huge impact, Shoot to Thrill is a playbook 80s rock song, that turns out great through the screaming of the lead singer and Youngs electrifying guitars.  Rock and Roll Aint Noise Pollution is a relatively simple song that manages to be great.  All the songs have good lyrics if you can decypher them, and the digital remastering really shows.  When I first previewed this new CD before buying it, I noticed right away the difference in You Shook Me All Night Long.  The intro has new depth I could never hear.  If you like this sort of music, this is a must buy, along with AC/DCs other great albums.      ',spam
' A105GWGM7PDAI2	B00005QEFD	March 22, 2003	3	3	5.0	An Excellent System With High Quality Games	 This is another great system that Nintendo has brought us.  It has a great variety of games, and shows a lot of promise in the future.  Lets take a look: System Its nice and small, can fit pretty much anywhere without trouble.  As the name indicates, GC is a cube, making the shape of it pretty novel.  There is a handle on the back of the system, so if you need to carry it around, you can, easily.  The PS2 is bigger, but is thin, so its got the next best size, the X-BOX however, has a size problem.  Its pretty big, making it the worst, size-wize.  Graphical power comes at a price. Media Gamecube has the most novel media.  It takes 3" disks, rather than the traditional sized CDs that other systems take.  This makes it cooler than the others, because these disks are ridiculously small.  There fun to use, and give the GC an aesthetical advantage over other systems. Graphics Over PS2, GC has pretty good graphics.  There is a nice framerate in all the games, and theres never really been a problem with good games, graphic-wise.  PS2 has very good graphics, but nowadays, I think that GC is beginning to get better graphics.  X-BOX will have better graphics for now.  It is the most powerful system out there, so they can pull off some pretty big graphics accomplishments. Games GC has an overwhelming number of high-quality games, with many planned for the future.  Games like Mario: Sunshine, Metroid Prime, Super Smash Bros, Zelda: Wind Waker, and others have always had a mark of quality above other games.  Though GC may not have the widest selection, its games are high quality.  PS2 and X-Box have more games, and a different type, but GC has always had a special brand of game. Controller The controller for GC is awesome.  Its a little small, but its easy to get to all the buttons, and even people with larger hands can use it.  PS2 has a good controller too, but its not as nice feeling as GCs.  X-Box controllers have always been huge, but now theyve released a new, smaller controller I havent used yet. Other GC has internet capability, but it hasnt taken off yet, which is a shame.  It has four controller slots which is great, allowing for some good party action. Cons People tend to look at this as a kiddie system, but with games like Resident Evil and Metroid Prime, that image is going down.  That image hasnt helped out GC in the older gamer market.

' A105GWGM7PDAI2	B00007GPI1	January 4, 2003	9	9	5.0	Best PPC for its price!	 This is my first PPC, but my 2nd PDA, and I love it.  My other one was a Palm IIIxe, and when the screen shattered because I dropped my backpack, with all my books, right onto it.  So I got another one, but I upgraded to a PPC.  The new xScale processor that this PPC has, by Pentium, only uses as much processing power as it needs, which helps to conserve battery power.  The Axim is bigger and heavier than many PPCs, but its still a handheld, and I usually like my electronics to be heavy, because to me, it gives me a sense of security that it is sturdy.  The Axim has rubber grips on the side, so that youll have a hard time dropping it, and you can get a good grip on it.  It has a microphone for recording notes, and even has a button on the side that you can use to dictate reminders to yourself quickly if the need arises.  There is an included speaker, but if you turn the volume all the way up, the sound quality is not the best, so I recommend using head phones if you plan to listen to a lot of music on your Axim.  The Axim has two expansion slots, a compact-flash and a secure-digital slot.  I think it is great that it has both, because I could use a compact flash modem and still have increased memory space using the secure digital card.  The Axim is also only about half as much as many other high-end PPCs that are currently on the market.  Its RAM and ROM are sufficient if you only plan to use included programs, but I recommend expanding with a memory card for keeping pictures, MP3s, and other files on your PPC.  The few things I dont like about the Axim are that it came with only one stylus, which I will probably lose before I can buy more from Dell, the case included with the Axim is really cheap and not worth using (The Axim can turn itself on while in the case), and that there arent very many acessories available for the Axim at this time.  Since my last PDAs screen broke, I am working hard to find a good screen protector for my Axim.  I have heard that Dell plans to release numerous acessories, including a keyboard for the Axim in the near future, which I hope will indeed happen.  In summary, if youre looking for a low-priced, high-end pocket PC, then go for the Axim!  I would buy another one if this broke, and as its looking, it wont.      ',spam
' A105GWGM7PDAI2	B00006IJJK	December 22, 2002	2	2	5.0	Excellent Game For All Gamers	 This is the first game I bought for Gamecube, and of the Playstation 2 and Gamecube games Ive played, this is one of the best.  A first-person-shooter based from the earlier Metroid games, which were side scrollers, this is an action game for all people, whether fans of the other Metroid games or not.  As a FPS, this is one of the very best Ive played on a platform, though there is a flaw.  In many console and PC FPS games, you can look around as you run, but this isnt so in Metroid Prime.  In this game, you need to stop moving if you want to look around, which is a major downside.  Other than that, the game is awesome.  This game brings elements from the earlier games and transforms them beautifully into a 3D environment.  Metroid Prime has wonderful environments, from the fiery Magmoor Caverns to the icy Phendara Drifts, sometimes I just have to take a look around the room Im in to take in all the detail that has gone into the game.  The enemies are all excellently transformed from 2D to 3D in the case of Metroids and other enemies from the older games, and are all very well made.  My only complaint, besides that there is no way to look around while running, is that the way the story is presented, there doesnt seem to be a sense of urgency to whats happening.  The main plot is that you, Samus Aran, after investigating an abandoned Space Pirate ship, have learned that the Space Pirates are trying to harvest a deadly poison brought to the planet Talon IV on an asteroid, Phazon, to use in their weapons and as a power source.  You spend the rest of the game going around Talon IV trying to recover twelve artifacts left by the Chozo, an ancient race who went to Talon IV after deciding that technology was not what they wanted, and were eventually killed by the Phazon.  Samus must get to where the Chozo contained the asteroid that brought Phazon to Talon IV and keep the Phazon from getting into the hands of the Space Pirates.  You travel between the four main areas of the game, the Talon Overworld, Chozo Ruins, Magmoor Caverns, and Phendara Drifts, to find upgrades to your weapons as well as new abilities.  As you travel, you will gain access to new areas based on what you have.  For instance, upon gaining the ability that allows you, in morph ball form, to gain boosts of speed, you can launch yourself up a half-pipe wall to gain the double-jump ability, which allows you to jump to a previously unreachable ledge, and the result is that you can get the wave beam, so that you can unlock new kinds of doors, and so on.  The game, in short, is excellent, and I recommend buying it for anyone.  If you dont like action games, then rent it first, but otherwise, it is a must-have for anyones game collection.      ',spam
' A105GWGM7PDAI2	B000069D39	November 30, 2002	2	2	4.0	Multiplayer Shines	 This game is a great buy.  The story mode is interesting, but it doesnt really interest me enough to keep playing through it.  The real reason this game is great is because of the multiplayer modes.  It also has some interesting one player things that are really great.  The multiplayer is fast-paced, but manageable, which keeps the games interesting.  There is a lot of just running around killing everything that moves, but there are certain new and interesting things that you can unlock.  One for instance, is the virus mode.  Out of ten players, one starts off with a virus, and has to spread the virus to everyone.  Flame tag is similar, but only one person is tagged at a time, and if youre on fire when the game ends, you lose.  These sorts of interesting additions to the classic capture the flag and deathmatch type multiplayer games, makes the play interesting and fun all the time.  The one player arcade mode is great.  It provides a bunch of challenges that unlock multiplayer characters, game modes, and levels.  The challenges, which include things as simple as get ten kills in ten minutes to the complicated like infiltrate the enemy base and destroy certain things, are always portrayed with a twist on the story or create their own story to make the challenges make sense.  These arcade levels are excellent, and its rewarding to actually get things for beating them such as characters or levels.  There is another single player mode, Challenge, that I find rather difficult, but still entertaining.  It just has random things to do such as break the glass in a level or kill wave after wave of enemies or collect all the banannas if youre the monkey.  The single player mode is interesting for a while, but I find that there is little or no story progression, which made me uninterested.  Each level has its own story, in Chicago, you have to kill the main mob man, in Siberia you have to eliminate the biohazard container with an alien inside it etc.  Things like that within the level.  What Ive found however, is though you get through the levels story, the levels dont really progress the main story of the game, which involves the Timesplitters.  Though it is fun, buy this game for the MP, Arcade, and Challenge rather than the story mode.      ',nonspam
' A105GWGM7PDAI2	B000067DNF	November 17, 2002	0	0	5.0	Excellent DVD For An Excellent Movie	 The movie itself is a masterpiece, and is one of my favorites.  The DVD makes the movie much more of great experience.  The only problem that Ive had with this DVD is that you cant view the movie in its original, theatrical form, but its not too much of a problem because the added scenes really add to the movie, and I now think of the theatrical edition as the lesser edition.  The movie itself had to be split up onto two DVDs because of all the commentaries that are now on the DVD.  With many movies that Ive seen, the commentaries will start off strong and interesting, but will soon be reduced into long gaps and the director saying, "I really love this shot here..."  and then trailing off again.  Not so with this DVD.  All I have watched so far is the director and writers commentary, and it is very interesting, and there are very few long gaps of silence.  This DVD is huge, and it will take me a very long time to get through all the features on it.  As an added bonus, on this DVD you can find the Two Towers trailer that was attached to Fellowship of the Ring while it was still in theaters, and you can also see MTVs spoof of the Council of Elrond scene.  The second two discs have a treasure trove of stuff to go through, and I havent seen much of it, but what I have seen is very interesting.  This DVD is a must have for any LOTR fan, and is a welcome addition to my DVD collection.  The sound quality seems to have been improved dramatically from the theatrical DVD release.  All in all, this is a great DVD worth buying.  The packaging is even interesting to look at.      ',spam
' A105GWGM7PDAI2	B000059TPN	September 24, 2002	1	2	5.0	Great Sean Connery	 This is a great movie.  Id recommend the movie to any lover of Sean Connery, Nick Cage, Ed Harris, or action movies.  Any type of movie for that matter. Sean Connery seems made for this role, a bitter British agent improsoned for life without trial.  His cynisism and great quips make this movie a joy to watch.  He constantly will snap back to Nick Cage with a wonderful little quote, my favorite being "Losers whine about doing their best..... Nick Cage also gives a great performance, and he seems almost made for the role as a reluctant chemical engeneer thrust into an environment he doesnt understand with a man he doesnt trust or know.  The movie plays Cage off of Connery, and the result is great dialouge mixed with awesome action sequences.  Ed Harris plays the angered general who doesnt want his men, killed in top secret missions with him, to have their families go uncompinsated.  You get a great view at his inner torments of wanting his goals to be completed, however, he doesnt want to be responsible for the deaths of many people in San Fransisco.  The movies action and acting is superb, and it is one of my favorite movies.  Id definatly recommend it.      ',spam

Good thing I waited to buy this case, as it is far superior to any generic case I could have bought.  This case is the perfect size for my Elph, it does add size to the camera, making it harder to get in your pocket, but the belt clip works great, so its hardly ever a problem.  Good color for the case, and the front pocket holds enough to help out when you need another battery or flash card.  The strap still comes out of one of the sides of the case, so you can still use it.  Not a case to protect from the elements, but it will protect from impacts VERY well.  For its price, less than the generic cases, and its great fit and quality, I would most definatly buy this case again if my current one were to ever wear out or become lost.      ',nonspam
' A105GWGM7PDAI2	B00005RT08	September 5, 2002	46	53	5.0	Best Of Three New Consoles	 Out of the three consoles released in 2000-2001, I believe that the PS2 is the best for a few reasons, and I will compare these to the other consoles. Games - PS2 has the largest and most varied selection of the three systems, allowing for a wider audience of games, and since quantity isnt better that quality, many of the games are great to boot.  Gamecube has a fair amount, more quality games, but of less quantity.  X-Box has very few good games in my opinion, not many 3PDs.   Size - The vertical stand allows the PS2 to take up about 8 inches of space on the floor, or 3 inches tall if stood horizontally in a TV cabinet.  Gamecube is the only one that tops this, about 8" by 8" by 8", but this also means its awkward in a TV cabinet.  X-Box is huge. Controllers - PS2s controller seems the perfect size and shape, from PSX analog controllers.  Gamecubes controller feels perfect in my hand, but is small, and the buttons arent all the same size, making games like Tony Hawk 3 weird to play.  The controller for X-Box is huge, and is very awkward to hold. DVD Playing - A DVD player would be better to have than PS2, but it is still great.  Also, PS2 plays DVDs right out of the box, while GC cant play DVDs at all, and you NEED to buy a remote for X-Box to play them.  Your DVD viewing experience will be better if you buy the remote, but at least its not mandatory. Other - The PS2 looks really cool, and so does the GC, while in my opinion, X-Box is very bulky looking.  The multi-tap, while not included, allows for 5 player play, which is supurb in some games.  GC allows for 4 player play anyway, which is great, and has some awesome party games.  X-Box has 4 controller slots as well I believe, but not as many fun party games. Cons - Not many I can think of, DVD playback can sometimes be difficult, my first PS2 broke after about a year, but this is because it was dropped from a height of about four feet, so as long as you dont drop it, you should be all set.  Disc Read Errors when nothing is wrong can get annoying, but it is easily fixed. So in short, I believe that if you are going to purchase a system other than the superior Playstation 2, you should buy Gamecube, and X-Box is probably going to be a poor choice for you.

Its transfer speed does talk a second or two, but its not long enough to make me irratated.  Also, the two sides of the card are very different, so I can tell which side goes up.  The card also looks very cool, very shiny.  Before you buy this one, however, make sure that its the kind of card your camera/MP3 player/etc. takes, so you dont end up like the reviewer who said your MP3 player would need to be the size of a boombox to use this card.  Another plus is that this is the cheapest 128meg card I have seen on Amazon.com.  For a great value for a 128meg card, definately buy this one.      ',nonspam
' A105GWGM7PDAI2	B0000645C9	August 21, 2002	11	16	5.0	Excellent Camera, Good Price	 This is by far the best camera I have ever bought.  It is my first digital camera, and its performance far exceeds the performance of my past film cameras.  For its size and price, this camera is excellent.  Compared to the S330, I would buy the S330, but I couldnt afford it when I bought this. The Good Takes great motion pictures - I took a picture of my fan while it was moving, and the picture came out as if it were still! Size - Nice and small, but big enough that me, with larger hands, can still operate it Movie Mode - Dont buy the camera for this mode, but its a great toy to fool around with Sturdy - Even though its small, it feels tough The Bad Included CF - Only 8meg card.  Thats only about 12 pics.  I bought a 128meg card, which is much better, because I can hold about 100 high res pictures or 200 med res. No Case - The case isnt included, and is selling for [$$], and Canon could have easily included this Zoom - Only 2x.  Not very helpful, but its better than 1x The Ugly Nothing really So, in short, if youre looking for a mid-priced camera for school, work, or vacation that is good for its size, go for this camera.

' A105GWGM7PDAI2	B00004TJCL	August 19, 2002	1	4	1.0	Great Game, But Ill Get to the One Star	 Counter-Strike is a spectacular mod for a spectacular game.  Half-Life, though somewhat outdated now, is still one of the best FPS games ever made.  The gameplay is superb, and the mods that have spawned from the game are great in their own right.  Counter-Strike is one of those great mods.  Counter-Stike is so great, that Sierra decided to sell a retail version of the game.  This is why I am giving this only one star, in spite of the spectacularness of the game.  Go to pretty much any website where games can be downloaded, and you can get this game, provided you have Half-Life, for free.  Yes for free.  The file however, is fairly large, but even so, it is probably worse to buy a game you can get for free than it is to leave a slow internet connection on all night so you can get this game.  Basically, this game is great, and though it is worth the price, it is still available for free, so that price isnt worth it.      ',nonspam
' A105GWGM7PDAI2	B00005V3TH	August 19, 2002	4	5	3.0	Second Worst Sims Expansion	 I rather dislike this expansion.  I own all four expansions for the PC Sims, and this is one of my least favorites.  Personally, I dont think the addition of vacation mode adds much to the game after Hot Date, since vacation mode seems just like downtown, but slightly modified.  Also, most of the new items are only available in vacation mode or are heavily themed to the vacation aspect, which, like I said, isnt very good.  So, if youre a big Sims fan and are trying to collect all the expansions or something, or just think that your sims need a vacation, you should buy this.  But for the rest of you, Id either wait for the price to drop more, or just not buy it.      ',nonspam

I think the only game that occupied my attention this much was my three day rush to beat Summoner so I could return it before it was selling, not returning for full price.  I race whenever I have free time, and it doesnt get old because simulation mode keeps thing fresh, and I will have stuff to beat there for a long time.  I race my friends, and we have great fun doing it.  There are many cars and some are really cool, but sadly, no Porsche.  However, there is RUF, whose body designs are modeled on a German made car.  Guess which German car that car is?  The Porsche.  The game always has something new to offer, and is an all round great game, besides being an excellent racing game.  I think the only way GT4 could top it is if it were the same quality game, but futuristic.  That would be cool...  Buy the game to cure your perpetual boredom!      ',spam

Id definatly buy this movie for the movie, but if youre a DVD buff looking for a DVD jam-packed with special features, hold out until November to buy the Special Edition with four DVDs.  The movie itself is great, but the DVD is a little twitchy.  Right out of the box, some parts of it skipped for me.

I love the fact that now, some fifteen seasons later, Fox has finally started releasing the seasons on DVD.  I have both seasons, and I cant wait for the third.  I was suprised by the lack of features on the first season DVD set, and although there arent very many here, there are more, which is great.  I love most of the episodes in this season, and I think some of them are my favorites, plus, we get the first Treehouse of Horror.  Now, the fatal flaw - Before you get to touch the episodes, you ahve to go through an annoying spin the heads game, where you get the correct heads to go on the correct bodies of characters.  Its always three or something spins before it happens, but it is very annoying after the first time.  I dont like having to go through this annoying feature every time I switch discs, which is frequently, since I browse my favorite episodes, and theyre spread over the discs.  Even because of this, all Simpsons lovers, and even occasional viewers should buy this DVD set!      ',spam

I have played as the other races in custom games, but Im not going to tackle Battle.Net (Although Im sure that is excellent) until Ive gone through the game.  Anyway, the game is one of the best RTS (Real-Time-Strategy for the uninitiated) games Ive ever played.  The story is engrossing, and I cant wait to play more to find out what happens to the world in Warcraft.  All the races, although very different, are pretty much perfectly balanced.  The aspects that are different from the older Warcraft games are great, such as the addition of two races, the 3D view (You can zoom in to be right in the action), and the addition of the Hero unit is great.  I love the Hero, because it combines an RPG element with an RTS, and I love both.  The union is superb.  The cutscenes in this game are also excellent.  I wish I had bought the Collecters Edition so I could get the cutscene DVD.  I would buy this game, it is well worth the money.  I hope Blizzard continues to produce games of this quality, and I cant wait for World of Warcraft to come out.  This game, in my opinion, is far better than Starcraft or the other Warcraft games.  Buy it!      ',spam

Im in high school, and this camera is perfect for what I use it for, carrying it around in my pocket so I can take pictures whenever I want to, of my friends and of funny things that happen.  The only thing I dont like is the small size (8 MEG) memory card that comes with it.  I have to move pictures off of it every day so I have room for more pictures the next, and I dont have enough money to buy the 256 MEG card that Ive had my eye on for a while.  A larger memory card and extra battery are good things to buy.  Other than that pictures taken in the dark are not as nice as Id like them, Id say that this camera is perfect.      ',spam
' A105S56ODHGJEK	B00005U2LB	December 19, 2001	15	16	5.0	Album Of The Year	 After a disappointing album loaded with watered down commercialized tracks, Nas has set out to prove he still has what it takes to be crowned the King of New York. And with Stillmatic, he proves it beyond a shadow of a doubt.  The album kicks off with a hot intro, laced with a nice beat and solid flow. From there, we find ourselves listening to Nas verbally tear apart Jay-Z on the viscious "Ether," which features enough hot punches to make Ali cringe.  The albums first single, "Got Ur Self A...." is another banger that you cant help but nod your head to. Far from "Nastradamus," the title track and lead single off his last album, "Got Ur Self A..." maintains a feel thats radio-friendly yet still raw.  The hits never let up after that: bangers like "Youre Da Man," the ridiculously original "Rewind," and "Destroy & Rebuild," (which throws lyrical darts at Prodigy, Cormega, and Nature), never lose an ounce of replay value.  "Rule" is reminiscent of "If I Ruled The World," another very nice track. And dont think for a second that Nas has sacrificed any street credibility on this album. Vivid tracks like "2nd Childhood," "My Country," and "Every Ghetto" among others will no doubt resurrect memories of the street poet we grew to love in 1994.  But the albums highlight is the beautifully-constructed "One Mic," which showcases a Nas we havent heard before. On each verse, he flawlessly flows gradually from a silky smooth tempo to a fierce, emotionally charged lyrical onslaught. An incredible track.  The albums only slight slip-up comes on the lackluster "Braveheart Party," which features a less than enthusiastic appearance by Mary J. Blige as well as a typical beat made for the clubs and watered-down lyrics. But this is literally the only mishap on the album, so it can be easily overlooked.  Overall, Stillmatic is the hands down Hip-Hop album of the year. Great production and masterful lyrics make this an album that not only reaffirms Nass spot among hip-hops elite, but also brings a breath of fresh air from some of the garbage thats been released in the genre lately. Every true HIP-HOP fan should own this album.      ',spam
' A105S56ODHGJEK	B00005S8M3	December 4, 2001	5	16	3.0	3.5 - fairly solid laid back album	 On his sophomore release, Nate Dogg puts forth a plethora of smooth funked-up tracks, many of which are executed nicely, with a few bumps along the way. What "Music & Me" suffers from is an overabundance of guest appearances, some of which dont serve any purpose at all other than to have the name listed on the album and attract that artists fan base to buy it. The album wouldve been much better with a majority of solo tracks rather than collaborations. The production on the album isnt bad, but some tracks come off bland. Also, Nate doesnt give all his effort on a few lackluster tracks, which really hurt the overall feel of the album. "Music & Me" lacks the diversity and great solo tracks that "G-Funk Classics," his first solo, had in abundance. But its still a good album if youre a fan of his sound, or youre just lookin for music to kick back to.      ',nonspam
' A105S56ODHGJEK	0792840119	October 16, 2001	0	1	2.0	A laughing stock.	 Disturbing Behavior is pretty much awful. The plot has promise, but is brought down by downright horrible acting (most notably from Katie Holmes, who provides nothing more than something to look at in this film), and pitiful dialogue.The one saving grace of the movie is Nick Stahl who plays Gavin. He portrays two different roles very well, switching from one to the other halfway through the film. Other than his performance, everything else about Disturbing Behavior is laughable. Need I even mention the ending, which is so dull it makes Al Gore seem like Jim Carrey. This film might please teenagers eager to catch a flick about other teenagers, and maybe catch a glimpse of partial nudity.But I would not recommend this film to anybody else.      ',nonspam
' A105S56ODHGJEK	B00005BCLT	October 16, 2001	1	1	3.0	Its a good movie....but...	 Bless The Child portrays the prototypical story of Good vs Evil effectively....to a point.The acting is hit & miss for the most part. Rufus Sewell portrays the role of a cult-leader nicely without going over the top. Jimmy Smits doesnt seem too inspired in this film, but nevertheless gives an okay performance. Holliston Coleman, the girl who plays Cody, does an excellent job in her role. Kim Basinger comes off bland throughout most of the movie, and the role Christina Ricci plays shouldve been extended to more than just two short scenes.The plot has obvious major holes that drag the movie down if you sit & disect them. And some scenes are ridiculously laughable / over-the-top. For example, a bird flys head-first into a Catholic-school window as Cody looks on. Next thing you know, all of the children are outside gathering around Cody as she holds it, while the nuns and Codys aunt (Basinger) watch and laugh whole-heartedly, not caring about the health issues that could arise from a 6 year old girl holding a seemingly dead bird she picked up off the ground.Little things..Characters always being in the right place at the right time. Smits character always finding clues and evidence that the dozens of cops at the scene seem to always overlook. Basinger not handing over key evidence that could save the child 30 minutes into the film, instead opting for the role of superhero and trying to infiltrate the premesis of a cult all by her lonesome. These along with other noticeable things bring down the film a few notches.However, the film is entertaining.If you sit and watch it just for the entertainment value and not for realism or disecting the plot, you should enjoy this movie. Its a solid story of good ultimately triumphing over evil, with a few thrilling moments along the way.      ',nonspam
' A105S56ODHGJEK	B00005NHLP	October 14, 2001	6	6	4.0	Solid album by a talented emcee.	 Tech N9ne is clearly a complex, versatile emcee, and deserves to be commended on that. You could even compare him to someone like Pharoah Monch, except even more twisted. With "Anghellic," he puts his wide array of skills to good use, executing a solid album concept very nicely. The albums highlights come on Psycho ...and This Ring, vivid tracks showcasing true mic skills, and solid production. On Cursed, Tech comes with a concept which is not new, but he executes it to perfection, making it another album highlight. Other solid tracks include the first single Its Alive, and God Complex.Although the album is laid-out very nicely, it does falter on a couple of occasions. Real Killer and PR 2K1 dont add anything fresh or exciting to the overall feel of the album. Other times, on tracks like Tormented, Tech sounds like he experimented a little too much for his own good, resulting in tracks that just sound sloppy. However, even on the albums weaker cuts, Tech displays his complex lyrical skills, which in some cases save a track from being complete trash. Overall, Anghellics flaws can be overlooked, as this is an album which makes most of todays overplayed hip-hop look like garbage. If youre looking for a complex, diverse album by a talented emcee, Anghellic is it.      ',nonspam

On her debut album, Mystic brings forth a beautiful blend of singing and emceeing over a varied soundscape, with a result that can be enjoyed by all fans of good music. She has a great singing voice, and displays it nicely on every track. Just as youre getting drawn into her soothing sound, she busts into emcee mode, spitting meaningful lyrics with a seemingly effortless flow.  The first single, "The Life," is an example of that. On "D Boy" she spits with fire & passion a vivid storyline about a young man caught up in the game. On "You Say, I Say," she slows down the pace on a heartfelt love track with a mesmerizing feel to it. The list of standout tracks is endless, as "Cuts For Luck and Scars For Freedom" has very few weak spots. At its cheap price, you cannot go wrong with this album.      ',spam

Almost every track is perfect. The production is smooth throughout. Megas flow is always on-point, and his lyrics are as well, staying true to the streets and real life instead of going for the mainstream crowd with the typical "ice, women, money" raps. The true gems on the album are "American Beauty," a 2 minute track on which he spits a vivid metaphorical rhyme about hip-hop, "The Saga," on which he describes street life masterfully over a great beat, and "They Forced My Hand," where Tragedy and Mega trade true to life rhymes over another smooth beat.  Other album highlights include "Thun & Kicko (featuring Prodigy)," "Unforgiven," and "Fallen Soldiers." Theres not a single mediocre track on the album. From beginning to end (including the hot bonus track), "The Realness" lives up to its title. Quite simply put, Cormega has dropped the realest East coast album since "Illmatic."      ',spam

On Faceless Ones, they create an almost eerie feeling, with a hypnotic hook and crazy lyrics. And on 2 Bogus, flict hooks up with Three 6 Mafia for a good blend of styles. The albums production, handled mostly by Wildstyle, is solid, and never drops off much at all. Overall this is a real nice album, a must have if youre a fan of Midwest rap.

The album is filled with hardcore tongue-twisting and solid production, even without The Legendary Traxster behind the boards for the majority of the album. The albums highlights are "U Dont Wanna Blaze" and "Kill - Steal - Will," which feature nice production combined with wicked flows.

From beginning to end, the album suffers from very few weak points. State vs. Kirk Jones features an all-star cast, which creates the perfect courtroom setting on a bangin track, helping to elevate the albums storyline.  Other noteworthy tracks include Come On, Money Talks, and the poignant Sister Im Sorry. The one real weak point the album has is on What If I Was White, an awful track featuring an unfunny cameo by Eminem.  Other than that, "Black Trash (The Autobiography Of Kirk Jones)" is a bangin album from start to finish. Stickys charisma and delivery are at the usual peak weve come to expect from him. And the production for the most part is top-notch. If youre a fan of good, solid hip-hop, this album should be in your collection.      ',nonspam

It looks like those shoes were the right size, because this album succeeds in just about  every aspect.  Dre uses the eerie music from the movie Halloween on  "Murder Ink," while Eminem and Xzibit make their presence known  on the bangin "Whats the Difference."

Thats getting ridiculous. Twista himself is only on 9 of the 20 actual tracks, and as expected, he turns in the albums best performances. Other noteworthy tracks by the Darkside Ballaz and High Beam also help the albums cause. The best point on the album comes on "Stories," on which Twista and former No Limit soldier Fiend both drop hot verses. Other good tracks include "Ball Wit Us," "Run," and "Peace Of Mind."

The album succeeds nicely in showcasing many different styles - toungue-twisting, club / bounce, hardcore, and meaningful. All of which maintain that North Coast sound that Midwest rap is known for. The albums production, handled mostly by the artists themselves, is surprisingly strong.  The albums highlight comes when Rif Raf and Don Deedy hook up on "Trip 2 Da Go," a masterfully constructed smooth twisting track.  Although the album has a few weak spots, this is still a nicely done compilation which accomplishes its purpose: to showcase P Family Records unknown talent.      ',nonspam
' A105S56ODHGJEK	B00005ARCX	April 30, 2001	4	6	3.0	Extremely average, and one-dimensional.	 On his solo debut, Layzie Bone (aka L-Burna) brings to the plate a slab of fresh production, most of which unfortunately goes to waste due to lack of diversity in his lyrics and flows.  The album kicks off with a solid Christmas carol type Intro, but the sad thing is, the Intro is probably one of the 5 best tracks on the album.  The albums highlights are few and far between, but tracks like Time Will Tell and How Long Will It Last combine masterful production with excellent flows, making for a couple pleasant moments on the album. From there, the album takes another drastic downfall until the last 4 tracks, all of which are solid. The second single, Listen, is very well done, and is well-placed as it leads nicely into the last track on the album, As The Rain (which is probably the best track on the album). The rest of the album is filled with mediocrity, and a few all-out wack tracks (Deadly Musicals, Make My Day, Lock-n-Load).  The album also has a few horrible hooks, the worst of which being Still The Greatest. The hook on that track ruins what wouldve been a pretty good song.  Overall, it wouldve been nice to see more tracks on this album like Mind Of A Souljah (Layzies solo on The Art Of War). But, its not a horrible album. If youre a Bone fan, you should pick this one up, just dont expect to be blown away with awesome lyrics or great harmonizing.      ',nonspam
' A105S56ODHGJEK	B000002LJF	April 13, 2001	1	1	5.0	Great old-school album	 This album may not be a "classic" 5-star album, but it brings back memories with every listen, and that alone is worthy of the 5-star rating. Every track is great, but the stand-out is the party track (track 11 I believe). I, personally, still remember kickin back on the porch and bumpin that track way back in the day.  Even the skit on the album is worth more than one listen. If you love old-school hip-hop and dont have this album in your collection, buy it now.      ',nonspam
' A105S56ODHGJEK	B00005ALH6	April 9, 2001	8	9	4.0	4.25 - All-around solid album	 On his sophomore solo release, Bizzy Bone pours out plenty of emotion, and touches on a lot of issues.  The Gift is a more well-rounded album than Heavenz Movie (his first album), for the simple fact that it has 13 new full-length tracks: not 8 tracks, an intro, 2 skits, a clip, and a song by someone else. The production on the album is solid, but lacks an extra element on a few tracks.  The album has its fair share of great tracks, such as "Never Grow," "Before I Go," "Dont Doubt Me," and "Father." And Bizzy ended the album nicely, with the laid back R&B-flavored, Gospel sounds of "Jesus." In fact, theres only one track on the album that isnt good. That would be "Voices In The Head," an awful attempt by Bizzy to sound like Eminem. This track shouldve been left in the studio. Also, its curious as to why he chose to include "Fried Day" on the album, which has been out for over a year. Its a good track, but he wouldve been better served putting on another new track in its place. Another minor problem is Bizzys voice, which, at times, can get tiring on this album. Whereas, fellow group member Krayzie Bone has a voice that never gets tiring or annoying to listen to.  Overall, however, any minor flaws are easily overlooked. This is an album not only Bone fans, but all fans of hip-hop can listen to and enjoy.      ',nonspam
' A105S56ODHGJEK	B0000541GR	April 8, 2001	2	2	4.0	Solid album.	 Straight outta Flint, MI, comes The Dayton Familys own Ghetto E with his solo debut. And while this isnt as good as his brother Bootlegs solo (Death Before Dishonesty), Ghetto Theater brings more of the same gangsta weve grown to expect from The Dayton Family. The first single, Lolipops, is a stray from that formula, but the results are infectious. This is a track youll have stuck in your head all day.  On the harder side, Ghetto E comes through with tracks like Ball Like Dat (featuring Shoestring and MC Breed), Playa Hatta (featuring Bootleg and Swift D), and Resume Of A Killa (featuring Bootleg, Esham, and Streetlife).  The album falters on only a few out-of-place and misguided tracks, but overall, Ghetto Theater is the perfect snack to hold you over until the next Dayton Family album.      ',nonspam

Gameplay is fun and keeps you coming back for more. Sure, the car physics and other aspects of gameplay arent realistic, but thats what video games are for: fulfilling fantasies. And while the Arcade course is easier and somewhat funner, the new and exclusive course offers a fresh challenge that will take some time and effort to master.  Bottom line, this is a game every DC owner should have.      ',nonspam

On "The Game," Richie Rich delivers more of what weve all been waiting for since 1996: His smooth, pimpalistic style.  The album kicks off with the bangin Strait Mall featuring B-Legit. Definitely sets the tone nicely for the rest of the album. Tracks like If, The Truth, Game Dont Stop, Bring The O, Whose House, How Many Licks (featuring Yuckmouth) and The Game all bring that funky West Coast feel thats unmatched by any other current artist. And he can still take you back old-school style, as heard on tracks like Playboy and Birds. Theres not a single track on the album that can be classified as fast-forward material.  But the albums highlight has to be the last track, Time In My Life, on which RR strays away from the sex & street tales that dominate the majority of the album. He describes growing up as a kid in vivid detail over a masterful beat. Absolutely stunning track, and the album is worth picking up for it alone. Overall, this is a very solid album, just as good and maybe slightly better than his 1996 release "Seasoned Veteran." If youre a fan at all of West Coast rap, and youve never heard Richie Rich, you NEED to pick both of these albums up. You dont know what youre missing.      ',nonspam

There are a few nice tracks, like Behind The Walls, Im Shackled Up, and War Wit Us. But the majority of the album is filled with just average music (the exception being Master Ps "Locked Up," which would qualify as just AWFUL music). The album also suffers from a lack of diversity subject matter-wise. While it serves its purpose as far as relating to the show, it makes for a monotonous listen.  Best advice: unless youre a die-hard Oz fan, save your money.      ',nonspam

This album packs a major punch. Tracks like Gimme Yours, Sugar Hill, and Mo Money Mo Murder (Homicide) are great, but the albums highlight is the Pete Rock-produced Rather Unique. This track is a masterpiece, plain and simple. One of the greatest tracks ever recorded.  If you dont have this album, buy it NOW.      ',spam
' A105S56ODHGJEK	B000053GUO	December 21, 2000	12	19	3.0	3.5 - Overall, disappointing.	 On his 3rd album, Xzibit seeks to finally break out from the underground and get exposed to a larger audience. It seems hes accomplished that, especially with MTV recently falling in love with his new video. This album will most likely go double platinum, but at what price? On some tracks, he makes you believe hes all-out given in, seemingly wanting to gain the respect (and money) of the millions of mainstream Eminem fans. Its a shame, because X has much more talent than what he shows on this album. The standout tracks on the album would be U Know (featuring Dre), Alkoholik (which features a great verse from Tash that really carries the track), D.N.A., Get Your Walk On, and Best Of Things, which is easily the albums best track. It features a great beat from Dre, and the kind of fierce, grimy flow that makes X head and shoulders above the average MC. This is the kind of flow that he used on almost all of "40 Dayz and 40 Nightz," and more recently on "Whats The Difference" and his guest spot on Kurupts album. Its too bad he didnt stick with it for more tracks. The rest of the album is saturated with mediocrity: watered down flows and beats which fail to grab the listeners attention. Kenny Parker Show 2001 sounds like a track rejected from an early N.W.A. project, with Xzibit sounding like an 80s MC Ren over an 80s beat. It doesnt mesh well at all. Rimz & Tirez is boring....not one of Soopaflys better beats in the least bit, and a horrible chorus that sounds like something they found in Outkasts trash can. And F You Right would be pretty good: the beat is actually entertaining. Except X blatantly bites the other X from the East (DMX). This may please the ears of the mainstream crowd, but its not as good as either of his previous albums. If you dont already have "40 Dayz & 40 Nightz" or "At The Speed Of Life," pick those up. Then maybe pick this one up somewhere down the line and compare them: youll see that it just doesnt measure up.      ',nonspam
' A105S56ODHGJEK	B00001IVOF	December 16, 2000	1	1	4.0	4.5 - Hauntingly dark and beautifully crafted	 The Mobbs 3rd release may take a couple listens to fully appreciate, especially considering it was the follow-up to the certified classic "The Infamous." But make no mistake about it, "Hell On Earth" is one of the darkest, grimiest albums ever. Havoc does an amazing job behind the boards (and on the mic), while P spits street tales like only he can. The album kicks off with "Animal Instinct," which sets the tone nicely for the rest of the album. The cuts that follow, "Drop A Gem On Em," "Bloodsport," and "Extortion" (featuring Method Man), are all classics, which will have you noddin your head and hittin rewind, as will just about every other track on here. Raekwon stops by on the bangin "Nighttime Vultures." And who can forget the classic title track? It ranks right up there with other Mobb classics such as "Shook Ones" and "Quiet Storm." While the majority of this album is bangin, there are a couple mishaps such as "Still Shinin," which really dont hit hard. But when theres so much other solid material, these mishaps can be easily overlooked. If youre into most of the bling-blingin hip-hop thats out there today, then this album is DEFINITELY NOT for you. But if you crave grimy, street-edged, hardcore hip-hop, this is an essential to your collection.      ',nonspam
' A105S56ODHGJEK	B00004S80U	December 16, 2000	2	5	3.0	Only 4 or 5 really good tracks	 This album isnt nearly as good as their earlier releases such as The End.  "Sippin On Some Syrup" and "M.E.M.P.H.I.S." are the only classic tracks on here. "Sippin..." features a great beat, catchy hook, and worthwhile guest appearance from UGK, while "M.E.M.P.H.I.S." is just an all-out banger featuring the Hypnotize Camp Posse. "Touched Wit It," featuring former No Limit Soldiers Fiend and Mr. Serv-On, is also a nice track. But outside of maybe one or two others, the album is filled with mediocrity. Nothing else stands out, and this ends up being nothing more than an average album. Its a shame too, because this album had a huge build up, and it only ends up disappointing. If youre a die hard 3-6 fan, you might enjoy this. Otherwise, save your money.      ',nonspam
' A105S56ODHGJEK	B000002B1M	December 16, 2000	3	3	4.0	4.25 - A highly underrated album	 It was just dumb that so many people expected Nas to produce another Illmatic with this album. Artists grow, and thus expand their subject matter. Unfortunately, this album got some bad reactions when it came out (and it still does), simply because its not Illmatic part 2. It Was Written is a great album from start to finish. "The Message" is just unbelievable: it ranks right up there as one of the greatest tracks of all time. "Affirmative Action" is another great track, showcasing Firm members Cormega, AZ, and Foxy Brown at their best. And on "I Gave You Power," Nas uses a vivid metaphorical tale to describe how hes like a gun. Other standouts include "Black Girl Lost," "Street Dreams," "Nas Is Coming," and of course the hit single "If I Ruled The World." The album falters on a couple tracks that dont really fit in well. But overall, this is a very solid 4 star album. If you havent listened to it in a while, give it another chance. And if you still dont have it, well, buy it!      ',nonspam
' A105S56ODHGJEK	B00002R0MA	December 16, 2000	36	41	5.0	A Hip-Hop Masterpiece, plain and simple.	 While most of the hip-hop coming out nowadays is filled with the same commercialized BS, Outkast continues to step their level up to new heights. Stankonia is a masterpiece, as was Aquemini, as was ATLiens, and as was their debut Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik. Not since A Tribe Called Quest came into the game have we seen a group drop more than 2 straight classics...Tribe managed 3 straight, but Outkast has just completed their fourth. The first two singles, B.O.B. and Ms. Jackson, are both extremely tight tracks, as is just about every track on here. So Fresh, So Clean, Ill Call Before I Come, Humble Mumble, Slum Beautiful. And Gasoline Dreams is so chilling that after one listen, you really will smell gasoline in the air. The list goes on and on. The standout though, if you could pick just one, has to be Red Velvet. The mesmerizing psychadelic beat fits perfectly with Dre & Big Bois flows.   Overall, this is an album you wont just bump this year and forget about. Its an album youll bump forever ever....forever ever?....yes, FOREVER.      ',spam
' A105S56ODHGJEK	B00005178V	November 27, 2000	15	16	5.0	Minneapolis own came through with the ALBUM OF THE YEAR	 I just wanna say that my man came through on this album. Quite possibly 2000s best hip-hop album.  The album kicks off with one of the tightest Intros in hip-hop history, right up there with E.1999/Eternal and Liquid Swords. Sandman goes off, flowin like hes possessed for over a minute.  On the bouncy "Whut You Gone Do..." he proclaims "(they) say I sound the same as Bone, but man youre wrong, you better recognize Sandman thats my name Im known for lacin everythang I own."  "Are You A Rider" is a tight track featuring a bangin beat, on which Sandman and Slink Capone trade verses. Their two distinctly different styles mesh nicely on this track, another album highlight. And on "Mental Bruises," Sandman hooks up with Evamo to create yet another gem.  "In The Mood" shows us his passionate side, as he proclaims his love for the opposite sex on one of the albums smoother cuts.  "Darklight" is nearly 9 minutes long, and features many members of his Mackilot click flowin like crazy over an eerie beat.  "Untitled" is a poignant track on which he tells us of the heartbreak hes been through--"I hope it all goes well with your baby, I hope this lover bout wont make you hate me....Its OK Im not lonely" But the albums standout has to be "Redrum II," on which he almost sounds like a combination of Brotha Lynch Hung, E-40, and Twista. The track is just plain off the hook: the beat, his flows, his lyrics, everything.  Overall, this is an outstanding effort from this young man reppin North Minneapolis. Hes definitely on the rise in the hip-hop game, and if he can maintain the level hes at on this album, he should be at the top in no time. BUY THIS! You WONT be disappointed.      ',spam
' A105S56ODHGJEK	B00004R95M	October 15, 2000	3	5	3.0	In A Mode is the only great track on here	 This is easily Do Or Dies weakest album to date. Production is for the most part below-average, and their lyrics have gone south.   That being said, Victory would get just one star if it werent for In A Mode, which is quite possibly the greatest Do Or Die track ever. This cut is smooth: it can be played over and over again and it wont get tiring. Other than that, there is not much else to be excited about. Already Know is a good track, and If U Scared & Keep It Real are alright. Who Knows has a strong Daz / Whoridas sounding hook, but other than that its a sub-par track.   Tracks 10-16 on this album are pure garbage. Murderers, Pimps, & Thugs is just flat-out wack. No other word can describe it more accurately.   Overall, this is a very weak album, outside of In A Mode and a few other good tracks. If its fast-flows and bangin beats you crave, pick up the new albums from Sandman and Flesh-n-Bone, and pass on Victory.      ',nonspam
' A105S56ODHGJEK	B00004TUFG	October 11, 2000	4	4	4.0	A good album in memory of a great MC	 Big Ls tragic death was yet another in a line of brilliant MCs whos lives ended far too early. We should consider ourselves fortunate to have this album: an album which turned out very nice.  There are no poorly constructed tracks, with random verses from L thrown together with an out-of-place guest MC (i.e. "Born Again"). Instead, the guests on here all shine right along side L, showing how much they respected him and his talent. The only oddly-concocted track may be Deadly Combination featuring Tupac. But even that doesnt come off sounding cheap.  The best tracks on here are The Heist, Flamboyant, Games, and the ghetto-classic Ebonics. Also, on Casualties Of A Dice Game, L paints a vivid picture over a nice beat: definitely another standout.  Overall, Rawkus did a nice job with this posthumous release. If youve ever heard any of Ls work, you should definitely pick this up.  R.I.P. Big L      ',nonspam
' A105S56ODHGJEK	B00004WJJU	October 10, 2000	6	7	4.0	3.75 stars is more accurate	 This is Flesh-n-Bones sophomore solo effort, and while its not nearly as good as the near-classic T.H.U.G.S., "5th Dog Let Loose" is still solid.  The album kicks off with The Last Tru Souljahs intro, which couldve been even better with an additional verse. Hero is an okay track, but its puzzling why they chose to include this as part of track one, making it hard to access (youll have to fast forward through the intro which is 3 minutes).  Way Back, which was originally included on the Mo Thugs 3 album, is slightly downgraded on this album. The beat is watered-down, and the hook is sapped-up. The album shines brightest when the production comes through tight, as in The Master, Kurupted Flesh, and Come F--k With Me, which is easily the best track on the album. The beat, the hook, the flow--everything is perfect. This is a track you can put on and just kick back to.  Unfortunately, the production is for the most part lackluster on the rest of the album. Tracks like Word To The Wise, Deadly, No Other Like My Kind, and Silent Night all couldve benefitted from a better beat.  Another problem with this album is that its, for all intents and purposes, a compilation. Its well-known that Flesh is currently serving time, which makes it hard (obviously) to put together an album full of new material. Thus, most of the tracks on here are 3 or 4 years old. Tracks like Amen, If You Could See, and Deadly have been available on the net for over a year now. And the rest of the tracks clearly have a 96-97 feel to them, almost as if they just missed the cut for T.H.U.G.S.  Overall, this is a good album, especially considering the adverse circumstances it was released under. If youre a fan of Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, youll most likely enjoy this album.      ',nonspam
' A105S56ODHGJEK	B00004W4QG	October 8, 2000	49	55	4.0	Playstations best as far as Football goes	 Madden 2001 can be described, basically, as a cleaner, fresher version of Madden 2000 for Playstation. There have been no real big changes as far as graphics: the game is still amazing considering its only 32-bit. But there have been several small upgrades--from the variable equipment, armpads, etc. that the players actually wear, to the all-around slightly better look of the player movements and the fields.  As far as the intangibles, there have been many improvements over 2000. The addition of Madden Cards is a definite plus, as is the 2-minute drill. The Hot and Cold feature is very interesting, and adds a more realistic feel. Do you start a cold Marshall Faulk, or a hot Trung Canidate? A cold Drew Bledsoe, or a hot Michael Bishop?  The Franchise mode has seen improvement as well: the salary cap seems to be more realistic now when signing free agents, and the NFL Draft is now 7 rounds instead of just 4. But maybe the best new feature is the addition of the Preseason mode, which allows you to pick your opponents for 4 or 5 games, to sharpen the skills of your rookies and get a feel for your new acquisitions. Then once the preseason ends, young players who performed well will see added points to their attributes. Really helps to develop rookies, and just to try new plays which you arent accustomed to using.   All that being said, this is still not the perfect football game. There are statistical errors you will encounter at various times, most notably the tracking of kick-off and punt returns during a season. You see, it only tracks 2 players stats for kick-off returns, and just 1 for punt returns. Thus, if only 1 of your kick returners got the ball during the first week, and at the end of the game the opposing team attempts an onside kick recovered by one of your linemen, the return stats for that lineman will be tracked for the rest of the season. And your second return man is left statless. Same thing with punt returns. If your returner is performing badly and you choose to bench him, his replacement will see zero stat-tracking. Pretty frustrating if that player returns one 80 yards for a touchdown.  Another minus is the commentary, which tends to induce sleepiness. Summerall has no enthusiasm in his voice, and Madden repeats the same stuff when he does choose to say something (he can go a full game on here and only speak 3 or 4 times). Youd think hed know he made his point when he says "Randy Moss is one of the best receivers in the league today." But then, two plays later when Moss makes another catch, you hear him repeat the same thing yet again.  Still, this is an all-around solid game, which succeeds in most areas. It is much better than Gameday 2001, so if youre looking for a football game for Playstation, this is the one you want.      ',nonspam
' A105S56ODHGJEK	B00001XDPJ	October 6, 2000	0	1	3.0	Chi-Towns lesser-known artists shine	 This album showcases some of the Chis hidden talent, with mixed results. There are some bright spots--Quarta Ounce lead the pack with a hot track, along with nice efforts from D. Villa and Triple Darkness. But a lot of this album is filled with mediocre tracks, which is what would be expected on a compilation of this sort.  The album wouldve benefitted highly with a few contributions from Chis big names, mainly Crucial Conflict, Do Or Die, and Psychodrama. And while Newsense from Psychodrama does appear on two tracks, its just not the same without SideKic and the HIGHLY underrated Yung Buck.  They made one good choice on here though, the inclusion of Twistas hard to find Suicide, a dope track on which he disses Naughty By Nature, among others.  Overall, if youre a fan of Chi-Town rap and want to become acquainted with some of their lesser known talent, this would be a recommended buy.      ',nonspam

What do you get when an MC wannabe makes one last run towards the top? Albums like this--full of mediocrity. Master P had his time in the sun, and that time is now over. The spotlight has been taken by a new Down-South bling-blingin label. Theyll enjoy their few years on top, and then the spotlight will be passed again. You see, stuff like this works in cycles. Youll have a certain gimmick: in this case, bouncy, club beats and braggadocio rhymes. That gimmick will be perfected by a group of MCs, who will rise to the top of the ladder, only to be overtaken by somebody else.  Now you see what has happened with No Limit. It started with the last TRU album, which came out around the same time Juveniles "400 Degreez" was blowing up nationally. You could see the wheels turning at that time. Then No Limit fell completely off the map for almost a year, releasing very little while Cash Money dropped platinum selling albums seemingly every month. Then we come to the big anticipation moment--the 504 Boyz album. It was supposed to bring No Limit back on top. Master P, Mystikal, & Silkk were supposed to hit us with a gem proving they aint fell off one bit. The day comes, and judgement is passed. Wobble Wobble, a recycled track, blows up the scene for a hot minute, but then drops off playlists about as fast as you can say "UUUUUGGGGGHHHHHH. People begin to realize: wasnt this album originally advertised as Master P & Mystikal? But yet, Mystikal is on a total of about 1 minute of the album. The Wobble Wobble video comes out--mysteriously missing Mystikals presence. And then the news: Mystikal has left No Limit, yet another in a long line of top-notch artists to jump ship (Fiend, Big Ed, Mr. Serv-On, Snoop, among others). And then maybe the biggest joke of the album: this "thug" named Krazy who garnered much of the albums spotlight. There have been some bad Tupac rip-offs, but this man is the worst. Voice, flow, right down to phrases, he tries his hardest and succeeds in biting Pac to no end. A complete disgrace and laughing-stock of a rapper, who Master P apparantly thinks the public will grow to love as "Pac reborn".....  By now, you should get the point. This album is complete garbage. The one track on here that is worth any of your ears time may be I Can Tell, a smooth R&B joint. But even that drips of No Limit cornyness.  In short, the albums last two tracks almost say it perfectly: "NO LIMIT--SAY BLAH."      ',nonspam
' A105S56ODHGJEK	B00004UAOW	August 5, 2000	14	14	4.0	Much better than I expected....	 I bought this album with relatively low expectations, after reading many  average reviews on it. But I must say, this is a much better album than  some mags and online reviews make it out to be.   Standouts on here  include the title track (in which he goes after Wyclef), the much improved  version of "Watch Who You Beef Wit," and the Canibus/Rakim  lyrical overload "Ill Buss Em U Punish Em." On "100  Bars," Bus flows nonstop for almost 5 minutes, definitely an  accomplishment not many in rap could achieve as smoothly as he did it. And  on "Horse Mentality," Cans 4 Horsemen brethren stop by for yet  another lyrical joyride.   But the top tracks on this album come back to  back at #s 9 & 10, "Doomsday News" and "Lost @ C."  Both feature sick beats and lyrically-viscious flows, sure to make your  rewind button hot.   All that being said, Canibus is one dimensional  lyrically on this CD--its all about showin off his battle skills. This can  be very impressive, and it is impressive on here, but it does tend to get a  little old after a while. There are no tracks like "How Come"  anywhere on here. No deep, meaningful lyrics. Even just one or two tracks  like that and this album couldve been a classic. The beats are far  superior to "Can-I-Bus," and his lyrical talent cannot be denied.  Its just too bad there wasnt a little more variety.   Definitely a  recommended buy though. He proves without a doubt that hes the illest  battle MC in the game.      ',nonspam

From beginning to end, you can play it all the way through without hearing any mention of "b--ches" "cars" "money" "jewelry" etc. that have taken over most of  hip-hop nowadays. Youll think you have been whisked away to 15 years ago,  when hip-hop was about havin fun...when the DJ was actually an important  part of the group.   The 4 MCs each have distinct voices and flows,  which really mesh with the old-school beats to make this album pleasant to  the ears. No loud noise and jibberish mumblings on here. Its hard to pick  out a few standout tracks, because this album is so equally balanced. But  "The Influence," "World Of Entertainment," "Jurass  Finish First," and "Contribution" are definite standouts.    This album is such a fun and easy listen that its also hard to find  any faults in it...maybe a few less skits? Either way, this is a must have,  especially since its available [for that kind of money in most stores. At that  price, you cant afford NOT to get this...go pick it up, and prepare to get  a fresh dose of some real hip-hop.      ',spam
' A105S56ODHGJEK	B000002WU9	July 22, 2000	10	13	5.0	One of the greatest hip-hop albums ever made.	 If you dont have this album in your collection, seriously, either you  dont like hip-hop or theres something wrong with you. This is a timeless  classic.   Im not even going to begin to describe why every track is  dope, cuz Id literally be here all night. Incarcerated Scarfaces, Glaciers  Of Ice, Ice Cream, Wu Gambinos, Heaven & Hell, etc...theyre ALL  classics. But if I had to choose two favorite tracks off of here (I could  never choose just one), theyd be Rainy Dayz and Verbal Intercourse.    Rainy Dayz is so smooth itll give you chills....I remember the first time  I heard this track, I played it over and over again, and just like the  whole album, it never gets tiring or old.   Verbal Intercourse lets us  hear with our own ears the transformation of Nasty Nas to Nas Escobar, and  Esco fails to dissappoint. Everything about this track is beyond  classic--the unbelievable beat and the flawless flows of Nas, Rae, &  Ghost combine to make this one of my personal favorite tracks of all time.    Now enough reading this review, BUY THIS  ALBUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NOW!      ',spam
' A105S56ODHGJEK	B0000024LQ	July 22, 2000	3	4	4.0	Solid album....	 From the title and sound of this album, youd never guess its Double Rs  debut. He really does come across nicely on here, and contrary to what some  will have you believe, its not just his great voice which makes him a good  artist.   "Lets Ride" sounds like a California Love pt.  2...pretty decent track. "Pillow" (featuring Dewayne Wiggins and  Rame Royal) is real smooth. And the Luniz stop by for a great guest  appearance on "Questions."   But the standout cuts are  "Fresh Out" and "Do Gs Get To Go To Heaven."    "Fresh Out" features a great beat which blends with RRs flow  smoother than anything you can imagine (Im not going to throw out an  overused term, i.e. "smooth as silk"...you get the point that  its smooth, LOL).   "Do Gs Get To Go To Heaven" is a  heartfelt dedication to Tupac, who passed just before Double R dropped this  album. One of the greatest Tupac dedications, if not the greatest.    There are a few tracks which couldve been left off this album, mainly the  pointless "Touch Myself" remix featuring T-Boz. But overall, this  is a solid debut album which is recommended if youre a fan of that West  Coast sound.   I just hope he hurries up and releases his next album  already...it was supposed to drop in the spring of 99!      ',nonspam
' A105S56ODHGJEK	B00004UAOW	July 21, 2000	3	6	4.0	A lot better than I expected it to be.....	 I bought this album with relatively low expectations, after his lackluster  debut and the early bad reviews for this. But I must say, this is a bangin  album! Most of the beats on here are 1000X better than on  "Can-I-Bus" and his lyrics are as good as ever.   The title  cut is reminiscent of "2nd Round Knockout," except this time he  goes after Wyclef for "spoiling" his album. Piano plucks echo  throughout the significantly improved version of "Watch Who U Beef  Wit," which is another highlight on this album. Bus trades  lyrically-sick verses with Rakim on "Ill Buss Em U Punish Em."  And his 4-Horsemen brethren stop by on "Horsementality," only to  get outshined lyrically by Can himself.   On "100 Bars," Bus  spits nonstop for close to 5 minutes. Definitely a highlight. But the best  tracks on this album come back-to-back at #s 9 & 10. "Doomsday  News" features Canibus spitting ferociously over a sick beat, almost  reminiscent of RZA at his eeriest behind the boards. And "Lost @  C" has another beat similar to "2000 BC" and "2nd Rd.  Knockout," with the church-choir like vocals in the background. And  just as you think the track is over too soon, Can busts back on the mic  with another ill verse, rapped with pent-up emotion that you can hear in  his voice.   There are a few tracks which bring this album down.  "Die Slow" & "Life Liquid" (both of which feature  Journalist) fail to motivate beat-wise. And as great as he is lyrically,  Canibus is a one-dimensional, battle MC. With a little variety in subject  matter and a few more sick tracks, this album couldve approached  classic-status. Nevertheless, its definitely recommended. Canibus is  probably one of the top 5 lyricists in rap today, and he proves it on just  about every track on here.      ',nonspam
' A105S56ODHGJEK	B00000DHSD	July 12, 2000	5	6	5.0	4.5 just because its way too short, but otherwise...	 This is easily a classic album...the album that kick-started Bone Thugs-n-Harmonys careers. This isnt their first album though: they had an underground album out in Cleveland called Faces Of Death before this.    There are only five actual full-length tracks, but all five are BRILLIANTLY  constructed classics. Thuggish Ruggish Bone was the first single, and also  the cut that started it all. This track never gets tiring, and same with  Foe Tha Love Of $, which features one of the most memorable verses in  history courtesy of the late great Eazy-E.   While those are the two  most recognizable tracks off here, the other three are just as good (No  Surrender, Down Foe My Thang, & Creepin On Ah Come Up). And you almost  have to count Mr. Quija as a track, but its more of a track/skit mix.  Great harmonizing.   The album ends with Moe Cheese, which is basically  a Foe Tha Love Of $ instrumental with an "ecstatic" woman lending  some "vocals."   This album wouldve been way better as a  full-length LP. We can only imagine 10 more of those thugged-out like  tracks on here...but, then again, we always have E.1999/Eternal.    Bottom line, if you dont have this album, have you been in a coma the last  6 years?      ',spam
' A105S56ODHGJEK	B00004TGY2	July 8, 2000	7	8	4.0	4.5 stars....GREAT album!	 This is one of the best debut albums Ive heard by a soloartist since Jay-Zs debut "Reasonable Doubt" back in96. Cap.1 comes RAW from beginning to end. He can twist his tongue as fast as Twista at times, but he also comes with a nice slower-pace once in a while.  The beats on this album are BANGIN as well, and fit nicely with Caps flow.  Almost every track on here is dope. Thug In Your Life, They Luv Dat, Get Up, Ride & Smoke, and Pure Pressure are a few of the standouts.  Chi-Towns Finest is a nice track combining Twista, Rawshawnna, & Cap spittin flames over an ill beat.  But easily the standout track (and my personal summer anthem) is Pop Dem Collas. This track has it all: sick beat, great flows, and a dope hook courtesy of Dwayne Wiggins. I cant even begin to describe how much I love that.  There are VERY few weak tracks on here, and even the weaker tracks would be above average on any other album. Overall, this is an album that youll bump all summer...no, all YEAR long. GET IT!

' A105S56ODHGJEK	B00004TE05	July 5, 2000	20	22	3.0	Hmmmmmm.....3.5 stars, just average	 This is the third installment of Mo Thugs albums, but this album fails to even come close to the quality level the last two albums had. A major reason for that is the absence of Krayzie Bone from this project. It was  run completely by Layzie Bone, and it lacks the special touch Krayzie had  on every track off the last two albums. Another reason for the drop-off is  the amount of artists who have dropped out of Mo Thugs. Souljah Boy, Poetic  Hustlaz, II Tru, etc. were all essential contributers to the last two  albums, and they are nowhere to be found on this. Also, the absence of the  eerily harmonious Graveyard Shift really hurts this album.   All that  being said, its not a BAD album. Just a little too focused on  thuggishness, which gets old after a couple tracks. Case in point: The  Desperidos, consisting of Layzie, Ken Dawg, TNT, Menenski, & Gold.  Aside from Layzie and Ken Dawg, the rest of them are just unlistenable on  this album. I think the comparison to Mystikal by the editor is unfair to  Mystikal, cuz hes far better than these nonsense-screamers.   But maybe  the worst track on here, even worse than a few of those Desperidos tracks,  is the awful "Seldom Seen." These guys have no place being on  anything having anything to do with Bone. This track is the ear-bleeder of  all ear-bleeders, and I could barely make it through one listen.   Those  low points being said, youd think Id be giving this album 1 star. But  there are a few very good tracks which really carry this album on their  shoulders. Emmortal Thugs really shine on their two tracks, "Last  Laugh" and "U Dont Want None." With a little polishing  lyrically, these guys have a lot of potential. Ken Dawg, as usual, comes  tight on every track hes on, including his solo "It Dont Stop."  Felecia also shines on this album on "This Aint Livin" and the  radio-friendly "2 The Playaz" with Skant. Other tight tracks  include the first single "Did He Really Wanna," and Layzies solo  cut "Everything Green."   But the standout track on this album  is easily Flesh Bones "If I Can Go Back." The only problem I  have with that track is its too short...otherwise its a beautiful  dedication to Eazy-E and those who weve lost over the past 5 years.    Overall, this is a real hit & miss album. Half of it is tight, the  other half shouldve been left back in the studio. But if you like the Bone  / Mo Thug sound (especially the Thuggish sound) then you might enjoy this  album.      ',nonspam

Lil Buddy is one of the few artists that has made it outta Minneapolis and now is finally BEGINNING to get the props he deserves. Its hard comin from a place like this (which is DEFINITELY not known for its hip-hop talent,  although there are MANY talented rappers up here).   This is a good CD  with nice beats and great guest spots from the rest of the Igloo Knob  family. Hopefully, this album will open the doors for other worthy artists  up here in the Twin Cities of Minnyap & St. Paul (Sandman & Macalot  and Upset Tha Locksmith just to name a couple).   Recognize!

' A105S56ODHGJEK	B0000488UG	June 15, 2000	11	11	5.0	On another level.......	 For those of you who thought Wu-Tang was dead, this album proves completely otherwise. After lukewarm Wu releases such as Raekwons "Immobilarity," Ol Dirtys "N**ga Please," & RZAs  awful "Bobby Digital," (as well as many others) it seemed as if  the Wu had lost their special touch. Then comes the build-up to this album.  Everybody was saying its on another level, that its the Wu of old.....and  were they ever right.   Production is handled nicely by several  producers. Surprisingly (or not surprisingly as of late) RZA only produces  two cuts, "Buck 50" & "Childs Play," but both are  definite stand-outs. But the main ingredient that makes this album so good  is Ghost himself on the mic. Dudes crazy! He can go from lyrics that  really get you thinking cuz theyre deep, to lyrics that really get you  thinking cuz they make no sense at all! "This rap is like  ziti".....hmmmm, does that mean hes "cooking" up a  masterpiece? Wouldnt that be the Chefs job? How about  "supercalifragilisticespialadoscious,  dosciousalaespilisticfragicalisuper!" LOL, its times like these that  give this album continuous spins. I personally like his crazy lyrical  style, and he comes at you with so much energy in his flows that you gotta  get amped-up every time you listen.   Definitely a must-have album for  Wu fans, former Wu fans, and Wu haters worldwide. BUY THIS!      ',spam
' A105S56ODHGJEK	B00001IVOH	June 15, 2000	3	4	5.0	Production MASTERPIECE	 On his solo debut, Pete Rock enlisted an all-star cast of guests to spit over some of the best work from PR to date.   "Half Man, Half Amazin" features a lighter-than-usual Method Man trading verses with  PR over a classic beat.   "Respect Mine" features the ever  slept-on O.C. over yet another classic PR beat. "Tha Game"  featuring Raekwon, Prodigy, & Ghostface is just ridiculous. Absolutely  unreal. NYs heavy-hitters spittin over another great beat. Ghost really  tears that one apart with his energetic verse.   "Take Your  Time" is a beautiful slow-jam featuring Loose Ends. "Da Two"  is a reunion track of sorts, as we hear the familiar voice of C.L. Smooth  over yes, yet another classic PR beat. "Verbal Murder 2" is just  sick. Everything about it, the beat, & the lyrics courtesy of Noreaga,  Common, & the late Big Pun. "Strange Fruit" features a  different kind of beat from PR, but Sticky Fingaz really shines on that  track.   The album may have been even better (if thats possible) if it  featured less of PR on the mic, but even his less than stellar mic skills  are made up for by his UNMATCHED work behind the boards. What more could  you ask for in an album than some of hip-hops best rappers flowin over  beats courtesy of hip-hops best producer?   BUY THIS ALBUM!      ',spam
' A105S56ODHGJEK	B00000FC6S	June 15, 2000	16	17	5.0	Great collection of some of their best work...	 This isnt an all-out greatest hits CD, its more of a greatest hits / B-Sides collection. Youll find some of Bones classic tracks like "Foe Tha Love Of $," "1st Of Tha Month," &  "Thuggish Ruggish Bone." But it also has some of their best  soundtrack & guest appearance tracks, like "Notorious Thugs"  with Biggie, & "War."   But the highlights of this album  are "Shoot Em Up" & "Days Of Our Livez." Both from  lesser-known soundtracks, these two tracks alone make this album worth your  money. "Shoot Em Up" is a beautiful blend of a smooth beat and  thuggish, hardcore lyrics. Thuggishness & Harmony at its best. And  "Days Of our Livez" may be my personal favorite Bone track of  all-time.   The album ends with a new track, "P.O.D." Nice  & smooth weed track.   Bone did a great job of putting some of their  best work on here, but also leaving the door open for a "Collection  Vol 2." Many great soundtrack & guest appearances were left off  here, including "Everyday Thang," as well as some of their  greatest hits, including "Crossroads (Uneeks remix)" & many  tracks off "Art Of War."   If you wanna get a feel of Bones  sound, definitely pick up this album. And if youre a Bone fan and you  dont have this album, WHATS WRONG WITH YOU?  Pick this up!      ',spam
' A105S56ODHGJEK	B00001WRNX	June 8, 2000	2	2	3.0	OK album...couldve been much better	 As the main producer of the biggest selling group in history, Bone Thugs N Harmony, DJ Uneek definitely has proven hes masterful behind the boards. The beats he supplied for albums like "E.1999/Eternal" and  "The Art Of War" went from eerie to beautiful with ease. So, it  was only a matter of time before he came out with his own album on his own  label.   "Ghetto Street Pharmacist" features many lesser known  talents from Uneeks Kingpin label. Its really hit & miss as far as  they go, either they show their talent or they come off wack on this album.    The best tracks, not surprisingly, are the ones featuring Bone.  Krayzie stops by for a nice guest spot on the "We Come 2 Serve  Em" remix. Layzie appears on the bumpin "Murda Murda," and  Bizzy stops by for just a few seconds on the R&B flavored "Doctor  Doctor" by Gemini.   The rest of the album, aside from the few  slow-jams, consists of hardcore beats and raps. "On The Run" is a  standout. "I Want Cha Lovin" is a nice track as well.   The  problem with this CD is it has too much filler, along with a few  uninteresting beats. This is definitely not Uneeks best work, and no beats  on this album compell the listener nearly as much as his work with Bone.  That may have something to do with the talent: Bone could make any beat  sound classic with their harmonizing and thuggishness, but I still believe  Uneek couldve done better on this album.   Although its far from his  best work, this is still a recommended album if youre a fan of Uneeks  sound.      ',nonspam
' A105S56ODHGJEK	B000003C0U	June 2, 2000	4	4	4.0	Good album.	 This album by the Mo Thugs offshoots is pretty good. Unfortunately, it got slept on heavily due to bad marketing, and it didnt even go gold. That may be one reason Poetic has left Mo Thugs to give it a go on their own (along  with several other former Mo Thugs artists). This also may be why the  hauntingly eerie "Still Waters" album by Graveyard Shift will  never be released. Although the death of group member Tombstone played a  role in that, its still unfortunate that theres not a big enough fan base  for this great album to be released.   As far as "Trials &  Tribulations," this is a rather short album, with only 11 tracks. But  its a nice collection of smooth beats and good lyrical content. Flow-wise,  PH couldve used a little work, but alongside Bone, anybodys flow would  sound just average. Speaking of Bone, Flesh, Layzie, Wish, and Krayzie make  appearances on "Intro & Insanity," "Day &  Night," "Parlay With A Hustla," & "Weekend  Buzz" respectively. These are definitely four of the strongest cuts on  the album, thanks mostly to the guests. "Weekend Buzz" uses a  classic sample and blends it into a smooth weed track. Krayzie drops a  great verse on there. He also produces much of the album, showcasing his  versatility as an artist.   Overall, if youre a fan of Bone or Mo  Thugs, you should definitely own this CD. If not, you should still give it  a listen. You just might like what you hear.      ',nonspam
' A105S56ODHGJEK	B00000ICNJ	June 2, 2000	2	4	1.0	Blah	 Ive never given an album a 1-star rating before--until now. If any album deserves it, its this one. Like the reviewer below me said, you always regret buyin soundtracks, but if you buy this one, youll regret the  decision even more. What a waste.   The big names are there--Mo Thugs,  Daz, Snoop Dogg, DMX, Eve, Luniz, Too $hort, Kool G Rap, etc. But these  have to be some of the wackest tracks put out by all of them, with the  exception of maybe Snoop. Id say some of his "Tha Doggfather"  & No Limit tracks have been wacker than "Survive," but not by  much! "All My Family" features recycled lyrics and uninteresting  flows by Mo Thugs & Layzie Bone. Same thing with "Ryde Or  Die" by DMX, Luniz, & Drag-On. Thats exactly what this soundtrack  does, drag ON and ON. I could describe why every track is wack, but I wont  bore you.   The few OK tracks (VERY FEW) would be the title track  "Turf Stories," "Playa Style," & "Shotgun  Style." Even those are borderline unlistenable.  Bottom line, this is  a complete waste of perfectly usable CDs and CD cases. If there was a  musical definition of wack in the dictionary, a picture of this CD would be  next to it. DONT BUY! Unless, of course, youre into wasting money.      ',spam
' A105S56ODHGJEK	B00000K51T	June 2, 2000	8	9	5.0	Bad Boys best release since "Ready To Die"	 If not for Black Rob and this album, I would consider Bad Boy a completely dead label right now, comparable to Death Row (which is also being held above water by one man--Daz Dillenger). After Cream Puffys ever-so-wack  "Forever" late last year, and a series of release dates being  pushed back for this album, I had begun to give up hope. Singles like  "I Dare You" and "You Dont Know Me" were beginning to  get very old and played out. But then Rob drops the hit track  "Whoa!" and my eagerness to get this album was rejuvenated.    And when the date finally came, after months of waiting, I was not  disappointed. The title track is a nice, but yet rugged joint showcasing  Robs superior lyrical abilities. "Down The Line Joint" mustve  been recorded quite a while ago, as it features everybodys favorite former  Bad Boy Mase. But its still a nice track. Same with "Can I Live"  featuring former Bad Boys the Lox. The lyrics are very out-of-date, as Kiss  spits "we cant lose, cuz Puff set us up properly." But still a  good track.   "Thug Story" is a remake of Slick Ricks classic  "Childrens Story." Rob definitely does this one justice, unlike  most remakes. And Cee-Lo stops by for a worthwhile performance on  "Lookin At Us."   Rob is a great lyricist, which he shows over  and over again on this album. And the production is actually very good. The  only minor flaw I find in this is the old tracks, but even those are hard  to look down on. If this album doesnt go platinum, when artists like Hot  Boy$, Master P, and even Puff are going platinum multiple times over,  theres something wrong with the hip-hop world.   Buy this album! You  wont be disappointed!      ',spam
' A105S56ODHGJEK	B00004T9UF	May 27, 2000	40	76	3.0	Funny lyrics and.....what else?	 Im not denying Eminem has skills to a certain level, but really. Once you get passed the funny lines, whats left? He has very little substance as far as lyrics go. Pretty much a one-dimensional MC. On "The Marshall  Mathers LP," youll find many stabs at groups such as Backstreet Boys,  NStynk, I mean NSync, ICP, etc, as well as Britney Spears and the rest of  the pop girl bands & boy bands. He gets his point across, and sure its  funny....to a certain extent. To me, an album like this consisting of  comedy is good for two or three listens. Youll be laughing listening to it  the first few times, but by the fourth time through, youll take it out and  before you know it theres dust gathering on the cover.   His one real  attempt to stray away from the funnyness is "Stan," a story about  a crazed fan who is suicidal cuz he cant be with his idol, Eminem. This  would be a very-well constructed story except for one thing--the first  verse doesnt rhyme at all. Still, it may be the best track on the album  simply because its a breath of fresh air from all the crazy lyrics and  misguided flows. Speaking of misguided flows, his attempts at switching up  his flow on a few tracks are all-out wack. He sounds like nothing more than  a whiteboy tryin to sound hard.   "Kim" is just loud  noise--pointless. "B**ch Please 2" doesnt match up to the  original. "Real Slim Shady," well, at one time that mightve been  a pretty good track, but after gettin drug through the mud by MTV, now its  just blah. And "Amityville" has to be one of the lousiest  tracks Ive heard in a long time.  Hidden amongst the mediocre are a few  more standout tracks, namely "Kill You" and "Marshall  Mathers." But those fail to push this album above "average"  status.   I am not an Eminem hater (why would I have bought this album  if I was?). But, to truly be considered a great MC, you have to come with  more SUBSTANCE than just funny lines. Take an artist like Mos Def for  example. He produces, he writes meaningful, poignant lyrics, and he has the  creativity to do a great song about plain old water. Thats the sign of a  truly great MC. Maybe on his next album, Eminem will try to push his limit  and step his substance-level up significantly. But as far as "The  Marshall Mathers LP" goes, he fails to capture and HOLD the attention  of the listener.      ',nonspam
' A105S56ODHGJEK	B00003IE26	May 9, 2000	7	9	2.0	Continuing the downhill slide since "Its Dark...."	 "Its Dark And Hell Is Hot" was a very good album, if not classic. But ever since then, it seems as if Dark Man X has been going downhill, as evidenced by "And Then There Was X."   You have  to give it to him for at least one thing on this album though, he did use a  variety of producers (Swizz, P. Killer Trackz, Grease, Irv Gotti, &  others), instead of the usual Swizz throughout the whole album. That  formula has gotten old and very played out. The problem with this, however,  is the variety doesnt necessarily equal better quality.   The album  kicks off nicely with the Swizz-produced "One More Road To  Cross." The first single, "Whats My Name," is a booming  track. But the albums standout has to be the ever-popular "Party Up  (Up In Here)." This is one of the best Swizz tracks Ive heard in a  LONG while (probably since "Its Dark...").   The rest of the  album is chock-full of mediocrity. On "What these B**ches Want"  (featuring Sisqo), Mr. Simmons reads off a list of women who hes  supposedly slept with, as if were supposed to be impressed. "Make A  Move" is an all-out wack track with some pretty laughable lyrics. Same  thing with "More 2 A Song," on which X spits "The game is a  lot bigger than you think you know. And if you think you know, then I dont  think you know." Creative stuff (sense the sarcasm).   The albums  token religious track, "Angel," fails to hit with the same power  tracks such as "The Convo" and "Ready To Meet Him" hit  with on his last albums. And he ends the album with a bonus track  ("Good Girls, Bad Guys") which wouldve been better just left off  the album.   Overall, this is your prototypical album with 2 or 3  bangers and about 10 fillers, with a few totally wack tracks mixed in. Not  too appealing. If you must have "And Then There Was X," pick it  up at the used CD shop and save yourself a few bucks.      ',nonspam
' A105S56ODHGJEK	B000000OV7	May 7, 2000	14	16	5.0	One of the greatest Hip-Hop albums of all time.	 I admit it, I was very late on this album. I just got it two weeks ago. But, as the saying goes, better late than never.   On "Illadelph Halflife," The Roots take it to a whole other level. "Do You Want  More? " was classic material, but this is a far better album overall.    Phillys finest kick things off with the bangin  "Respond/React." From here on, its nothing but sheer brilliance.  A perfect blend of bangin, street-edged tracks and smooth, jazzy, melodious  tracks.  "Sections," "Push Up Ya Lighter,"  "Concerto Of The Desperado," "Clones," "UNIverse  At War," and "Ital" (featuring Q-Tip), are all bangin,  flawless tracks. Then "Episodes," "What They Do,"  "No Alibi," "The Hypnotic," and "One Shine,"  are all well-crafted smooth, jazzy tracks. "No Great Pretender"  is easily the best track on this album, and it may be one of the greatest  tracks of all time. If not one of the greatest, definitely one of the  SMOOTHEST. The JFNs work on this track is beautiful.   And no Roots  album would feel complete without Ursula Ruckers poetry. This album  delivers there too, with "The Adventures In Wonderland." I love  everything about "Illadelph Halflife." The lyrics (Black Thought  is a genious on this album), the beats, the guest appearances, the  diversity, and every other aspect an album is judged on. If you dont have  this album, I very highly recommend it. You wont be disappointed!      ',spam
' A105S56ODHGJEK	B00001IVOY	May 3, 2000	7	7	4.0	Good album with some momentary lapses	 This is Xzibits follow-up to his debut album, "At The Speed Of Life." On this album, Xzibit displays growth as an overall MC, his lyrics and raw flow both being improved.   "What U See Is What U Get" is just raw, easily the best track on the album. "3 Card  Molly," featuring Rass Kass and Saafir, is an entertaining track  showcasing the trios lyrical skills. And "Los Angeles Times" is  another nice track with a great bassline. Other bangin tracks include  "Focus," "Deeper," and "Inside Job."    Where the album falters is in some of the production. Although the tracks  listed above are all well-crafted, others on this album are not. Case in  point--"Nobody Sound Like Me," the perfect example of what you  get when you cross a lame beat with an un-interesting hook.  "Shroomz" features some funny lyrics over an all-out WACK beat,  making it very hard to listen to.   Fortunately (at least HOPEFULLY),  this problem will not exist on X to the Zs forthcoming album, which will  feature mostly Dr. Dre behind the boards. But still, even with a few wack  beats, this is still a recommended album. If youre a fan of West Coast  hip-hop, you should have "40 Dayz & 40 Nightz" in your  collection.      ',nonspam
' A105S56ODHGJEK	B00001XDOH	May 2, 2000	7	7	5.0	HOT album, one of the best of 99	 Organized Konfusion is not only the group Pharoahe Monch is in, but it also describes his style. His wickedly twisted flow and lyrics might not appeal at first listen, but after repeated listens it grows on you.  The head-nodding, self-produced, ever popular first single "Simon  Says" is just a sampling of Pharoahes creativeness. He produced five  of his own tracks on here, another of which is "Behind Closed  Doors," a raw, bangin track. On the Alchemist-produced "No  Mercy," M.O.P. and Monch combine for a hyped-up energy overdose,  definitely destined to satisfy the listener (and wake up the neighbors).  And he ends the album with an all-star line-up on the "Simon  Says" remix, featuring the likes of Red & Meth, Busta Rhymes,  & more.  Overall, this album is full of rawness. Maybe not a  classic, but since 4.5 is not an option, Ive rounded up. Either way, this  album is bangin, definitely a worthy buy.      ',spam
' A105S56ODHGJEK	B00000IFT2	May 1, 2000	1	1	4.0	Slick Rick re-enters the rap game with a nice album	 Theres no doubt about it, Slick Rick was an old-school genius in the late 80s. Tracks like "The Show," "Childrens Story," and "La Di Da Di," among others, were classics. But his last two  albums, 94s "Behind Bars" and 91s "The Rulers Back,"  werent that good.   Fast-forward to last year, and the Rulers out from  behind bars. Question was, could MC Rickey D, ten years past his prime,  still put out a bangin album? The answer---a resounding YES.   With  production from Clark Kent, Grease, S&S, TrackMasters, and more,  "The Art Of Storytelling" offers a wide range of fresh beats  which compliment Ricks flow. The best track on the album is "2 Way  Street," which features a tight beat from the Superman producer, and  Ricks storytelling at its best. "Memories" finds Rick  reminiscing about back in the day, while "Adults Only" finds him  pondering about the back door.   The guest appearances are plentiful,  but most are awefully short. The best collabos find Rick teaming up with  Big Boi of Outkast on "Street Talkin," and Raekwon on the  up-tempo "Frozen." All in all, its safe to say this time the  rulers back for real.

On "Akn Bad," over a grimy beat, Mystikal steals the  show with the fast paced stutter-stop flow hes mastered. "Heart Of A  Ghetto Boy" is a subdued track on which Fiend slows his flow to match  the sax in the background. The track is a welcome break from the rowdiness  of the first six tracks. On "Walk That Line," he totally flips  his flow. You gotta listen to it more than once to fully appreciate it.  Other standout tracks include "The Rock Show," "Trip To  London," and "Waiting On God."   The album couldve done  without songs like "The Truth Is" and "They Dont Hear  Me," as they dont bring anything new to the table. But overall,  "Street Life" is one of the better No Limit releases of recent  memory.      ',nonspam

" ever hit store shelves.   The Roots may have been at a developmental stage on this album, but its still filled  with that classic Roots flavor. "Grits" is a fun track with an  entertaining hook. The self proclaimed "longest posse cut in  history," "The Session" seems to never end. Its well over  ten minutes long, but its not un-bearable. In fact, its actually an  alright track. "Essaywhaman," performed live at the Soulshack, is  early evidence of their brilliance in live performances. But the best track  on this album has to be "Leonard I-V." Similar to "Swept  Away" and "Distortion To Static" (off DYWM), this track uses  human voice as part of the beat. Very nice outcome.   Overall, although  the production on "Organix" is not as advanced or thorough as the  Roots newer albums, it still delivers in whats important---providing the  listener with some Good Music to enjoy.

This album does not measure up to that, but its still pretty good overall.   "Watch Those" is a nice track in which  Pun spits those same kinds of wicked lines he mastered on Capital  Punishment. "Its So Hard" finds Pun experimenting with a  different flow, in which he hightens his voice during the middle and end of  each line. Its also rather sad, as he says at the end of the first verse  "I just lost a hundred pounds, Im tryna live!"   "New  York Giants" is a hyped up joint, which isnt surprising considering  it features everybodys favorite hyped-up duo, M.O.P. "N*gga  Sh*t" features a dope beat courtesy of Buckwild, but its far too  short, clocking in at only 1:45. Other standout tracks include "Off  Wit His Head," "Leather Face," and "Laughing At  You."   The album trails off slightly at the end, with a few tracks  (and guests) that fail to justify their being on the album.  Overall,  despite its flaws and short length, "Yeeeah Baby" is still a  worthy buy.      R.I.P. Pun      ',spam
' A105S56ODHGJEK	B0000013GT	March 22, 2000	7	8	5.0	This album has to be considered a CLASSIC.....	 This is Kasts second offering. Their first album,  Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, was a classic, and this picks up where  that left off, literally "Elevating" them to other-worldly  levels. The title track is designed to get the party crunk, yet still  maintains a smooth feel. 90% of this album is nuthin but stand-out trax,  including Two Dope Boyz (In A Cadillac), Wheelz Of Steel, Jazzy Belle,  Elevators, Mainstream, Decatur Psalm, and 13th Floor/Growing Old. All of  those are beautifully constructed trax, which succeed on all levels. That  being said, the album does have its low points. Babylon drags slightly  with its lackadaisical beat. Ditto for E.T., which is an odd track in which  chiming noises and heavy breathing comprise the beat. I guess they were  trying to capture that odd "alien" type feeling. Overall,  however, this is a must-have album. With hooks that will have you singing  along subconsciously and beats that will keep your head nodding. Combine  those elements with Big Boi and Andres stutter-stop flows and lyrical  wordplaying, and you get that signature Outkast sound, which has yet to  produce anything less than classic music.

' A105S56ODHGJEK	B0000296UE	March 20, 2000	1	1	4.0	COG display some tight flows on their debut CD.	 Despite what some people may say, Chilldrin Of Da Ghetto sound NOTHING like Bone Thugs & Harmony. In fact, if you didnt know who they were, youd probably swear it was Crucial Conflict youre listening to. To me,  the seven members in the two Chi-town groups have the same exact sounding  voices. But what separates COG from being complete Crucial Conflict clones  is the talented Goldiiz, who not only can flow but he also PRODUCED this  entire album. Definitely some tight beats on here, and he also uses very  little sampling, which is to his credit. It comes out sounding like a  perfect blend of that West Coast, Hoo-Bangin feel and that MidWest,  Chi-town feel. Standout trax on here are the first single "Luv At  First Sight," which is not too sappy as the title might make it look,  "Its Time To Roll" featuring Mack 10, "Better Days,"  "Mistake," and "Hoo-Bangin COG Style" featuring Mack 10  & MC Eiht. On "Lonely," Juvenile drops by for a lethargic,  non interesting verse in which he sounds like hes congested, taking away  from the overall nice feel the track has. The second single, "Wild  Side," could easily be confused as a Crucial Conflict track, from the  title to the flows. But again, its Goldiiz work behind the boards which  provides the distinction. Overall, this is a nice debut album, showcasing  this groups high potential. A worthy buy.      ',nonspam
' A105S56ODHGJEK	B00000011E	March 15, 2000	10	10	5.0	Twista tears it up on this CLASSIC......	 Twista had an album out before this called "Runnin Off At Da Mouth," but on that, he was all about rappin as fast as he could. On this album, he steps up his lyrics AND flow to the perfect level. He  enunciates so well that you can understand almost every word he says, even  when hes rapping at his fastest. On the title track, Twista is just  downright amazing. In fact, it wouldve been better if he were on this  track alone, just tearin it up for 4 minutes. "Overdose" has a  slow, almost lethargical, yet eerie beat. "Mobsters Anthem" has  a beat reminiscent of the classic "Nuthin But A G Thang."  "It Feels So Good" & "Emotions" are both a nice  change of pace. On any other rappers album, these may sound like 2 sappy  tracks, but Twistas flow saves them both, and actually turns them into  some nice trax. But the stand-out track on this album is one of my favorite  trax of all time, "Unsolved Mystery." Traxsters beat and  Twistas signature flow are just undescribably dope on this track. This is  in my top 15 trax of ALL TIME. Overall, this album has to be considered a  classic. If youre a fan of gangsta rap, fast flows, or even just rap in  general, this is a must have.      ',spam
' A105S56ODHGJEK	B00003NHAR	March 12, 2000	8	9	3.0	"Anything" shouldve been on this album.....	 Why didnt Jigga include "Anything" on this album? It is very out of place on Beanies album, and I feel if he wouldve kept "Anything" and the Twista track on here, this album wouldve been  MUCH better than it is. Who wants to hear "Jigga My N**ga" or  "Girls Best Friend" for the 1000th time?  Regardless of those  definite mistakes, this album is still quality material. If there were 3.5  stars, Id give it that, but its closer to 3 than 4. "So Ghetto"  is the stand-out track on here. The classic Primo beat fits Jiggas  effortless flow like a glove. "Big Pimpin," produced by  Timbaland, is a classic track featuring the underrated UGK. But aside from  those two classics, a group of second-tier, just average trax fill up most  of the album. The beat for "Snoopy Track," featuring Juvenile,  sounds like a constipated elephant. "Things That U Do" is just  downright awful. And "Pop 4 Roc" is just more evidence of Jiggas  hip-hop to hip-pop transformation, which has rapidly been growing since the  classic "Reasonable Doubt." Hidden amongst the mediocre is one  more standout track, "Dope Man," which has an almost cinematic  feel to it. Overall, this album couldve easily been a 4 with the inclusion  of "Anything" and the Twista/Missy track, but to include two old,  played-out trax in place of those is just unexcusable. Pick this one up at  the used CD shop and save yourself $5.      ',nonspam
' A105S56ODHGJEK	B00001XDO3	March 4, 2000	1	1	4.0	Bleed truly does make it just fine on his own......	 Young Bleeds debut was hot ta death, no doubt, but there was just something about it that didnt click well. Maybe it was the label it was on, No Limit. While that did catapult it to Gold sales, it might have  turned some people off, thinking it was some more of the same ol No Talent  BS. Well, Bleed is gone from No Limit now, and his sophomore effort picks  up right where his debut left off. Although short at only 12 trax, it truly  is very well put together. Trax like "All They Lef Me Wuz Da  Streets," A Husla," "A Minute ta Breathe," and "My  Own" are very nicely constructed, showcasing that southern comfort  type feel to the fullest. This album has very few guest appearances, which  is a plus becuz it gives Bleed more time to shine. But Too $hort stops by  for a nice collabo on "Time and Money." But the best track on  here has to be "Trecherous." Clocking in at only 2:28, its  pretty short, but Bleed makes the most of it and rides the deep bassline to  the fullest. Overall, this album couldve been a little longer, as it  leaves you yearning for more. But Bleed has definitely proven that he  doesnt need Master P to be successful. He can do it all on his own.      ',nonspam
' A105S56ODHGJEK	B000003BZV	March 2, 2000	3	4	5.0	This album is the DEFINITION of CLASSIC....	 I cant say enough good things about this album. The Dayton Family is the most slept-on group in hip-hop. From beginning to end, and everything in between, F.B.I. is UNBELIEVABLE. It kicks off wit "79th &  Halstead," a bangin intro which sets the mood perfectly. "Real  With This" features a nice bassline, and a well-crafted beat, which  compliments Shoestring & Bootlegs flows. And the hits just keep  comin--"Killer Gs," "Blood Bath," and  "Newspaper" are all BANGIN as F##K! And then we have "Stick  and Move," which was also featured on the Down South Hustlers  compilation (strange, since TDF represents Flint, MI). But the standout  track BY FAR on this masterpiece is "Player Haters," which,  despite the over-used term, is OFF THE F##KIN HOOK! A tight beat, and  murderous lyrics that combine to produce one of my favorite trax ever. It  also features Esham, who lays down a nice verse. But what seperates the  Dayton Family from the rest of the played-out gangsta rap world is the fact  that they mix it up. In the same vein as "Oxydol" and "Thru  A Thang" off their first album, TDF lays down two poignant, deep, and  meaningful trax on this album as well, "Whats On My Mind 2" and  "Ghetto." That is why I feel The Dayton Family really needs to  get more props. These brothers are hard for sure, but they ARE NOT  one-dimensional, as most gangsta rap groups are. This album is EASILY a  classic. In my vast hip-hop collection, this CD ranks in the top five as  far as my favorites. Please, trust me, if you dont have this album, BUY IT  NOW. You DEFINITELY will not be disappointed.      ',spam

Mystikal shows why he is the most talented soldier on this well crafted sophmore album (his first was released on Jive/Big Boy). There are  MANY standout trax, one of which is the title track, on which Mystikal  spits that rapid fire stutter-stop flow hes mastered. "Here We  Go" is a nice collabo wit B-Legit & E-40, while  "Gangstas" features Snoop on one of his first No Limit  appearances. "Still Smokin" is his ode to those sticky-green  leaves, while "Dick On The Track" features some clever word play.  But the two STAND-OUT trax on here have to be "The Man Right  Chea" and "Shine." "The Man Right Chea" features  an UNBELIEVABLE beat combined wit Mystikals signature flow, while  "Shine" is a touching tribute to his sister, who was murdered  while he was working on his first album. "Born 2 Be a Soldier" is  yet another in what was the long running "Soldier" series of No  Limit trax. Not much to this one, basically fast-forward material. But all  in all, the high points on this album FAR outweigh the lows. In my opinion,  this album is DEFINITELY a worthy buy.      ',spam

Their first album, "Family Scriptures," is a brilliantly constructed MASTERPIECE. This album is very good, but not a masterpiece. Standout trax on here  include "Mighty Mighty Warrior," "Mighty Mo Thug" (by  the EXTREMELY slept-on Souljah Boy), "All Good" (despite the  played-out term, this is a nice upbeat track), "U Dont Own Me"  (although it starts to drag slightly, still a nice track), and  "Otherside." "Riot" by Flesh Bone is a well-constructed  track showcasing his slept-on skills. "Aint Said No Names" is  Krayzie Bones solo. Although its nowhere near as good as "Mo  Murder" (his solo on Family Scriptures), its still a nice track. The  only trax I really couldve done without on here are "Believe"  (despite what Krayzie might say, these guys are not the next Jackson 5),  and "The Queen," which features the whiny-voiced Thug Queen. She  has upped her skills noticeably since this, but on here she was a major  ear-bleed. Also, Powder ruins "Ghetto Cowboy," a track that  couldve been classic without his ten seconds of nonsense. In the end, this  album is definitely a worthy buy. If you dont already have Family  Scriptures, buy that NOW, then if you have some cash left over, pick this  up. You most likely wont be disappointed.      ',spam

This might be the best double hip-hop album ever. Disc 1 brings out many magnificent trax,  such as Its All Real (Krayzie solo), If I Could Teach The World, and  Family Tree. Not to mention possibly the best track on the whole album,  Its All Mo Thug, which even features Bizzy on his only track ever having  anything to do wit Mo Thugs. Its VERY smooth, definitely one of the  smoothest Bone trax ever. Disc 2 features a little more of the thuggish  side of Bone, as displayed on the shotgun-blast filled Thug Luv featuring  2Pac. One of the most hardcore Bone trax ever. Wasteland Warriors, 7 Sign  (Bizzy solo), U Aint Bone, & Evil Paradise also display the  thuggish-ruggish side of Bone. On the mellifluous tip (look it up yall),  Hatin Nation is a nice laid back joint, and so is Mo Thug Family Tree,  which features the same beat as Family Tree, but features Mo Thugs along  wit Bone. And then we have the obligatory weed track, Blaze It, which is  short but still showcases smooth harmonizing, perfect to spark one to. All  in all, this features very little filler, AMAZING considering its a double  album. A well-crafted DJ Uneek produced classic. If you dont have this by  now, youre definitely missin out.

It aint all about harmonizing over soft beats, which some of these so-called "professional"  reviewers might have you think. BTNHResurrection is far more than that.  This is an album signifying the return of the greatest selling hip-hop  group ever. Its also an album which might be the LAST for them as a whole  group. Yes, Bizzy Bone may be gone from Bone now, but he definitely makes  his presence known on this album. The album features stellar production  from DJ Uneek (Ecstasy, Weed Song,  & Change the World, along wit three  others), LT Hutton (Battlezone), JT Thomas (Souljahs Marching,  Resurrection), and Darren Vegas (The Righteous Ones, One Night Stand). But  it AINT just the production that is stellar on this album. Its the fact  that Bone mixed it up. Did somethin different. Experimented. And although  it leaves maybe an incomplete feeling hearin only three members on some  songs, its different. And its also nice to see Flesh & Bone get the  kind of spotlight he deserves, bein on almost all of the trax instead of  the two or three hes normally on on Bones albums.  The standout trax on  this album are Ecstasy (perfect blend of thugishness and harmony), The  Righteous Ones (a beautifully crafted track), Battlezone (Krayzie  absolutely RIPS this), Weed Song (almost sounds like a bedtime song youd  let your kids listen to before bed. SMOOTH. A lot of harmony), and Souljahs  Marching. And of course, Resurrection (Paper, Paper) which, although he  isnt in the video, features Flesh. This albums only drawbacks are trax  like 2 Glocks & Cant Give It Up. These little dittys dont do nuthin  for me. But, the high points FAR outweigh the low. So forget a magazine  review. Trust this one. Go buy this album NOW! You will NOT be  dissapointed.      ',spam

But "Next Friday" is actually better than most. "Fried Day" by Bizzy Bone is an amazingly smooth joint  reminiscent of "Buddah Lovaz" by Bone Thugs. "Chin  Check," the first new NWA track in years, is a great track, but its  hard to think of it as NWA with Snoop instead of Eazy. "Shaolin  Worldwide" by Wu succeeds, as does "Murder Murder" by  Eminem, a track which was originally on his Slim Shady EP. Other decent  trax by Pharoahe Monch & Krayzie Bone contribute to the success of the  album. The big (and I mean BIG) downfall of this album is the HORRIBLY WACK  lead single by Ice Cube, "You Can Do It."

Although this album is not a classic, if youre a fan of dark beats  and murderous lyrics, this will satisfy your appetite.      ',nonspam
' A105S56ODHGJEK	B00000JNKM	December 7, 1999	1	1	3.0	Shoestring hits hard but falls short	 Straight from Flint, Michigan comes the Dayton Familys Shoestring.  This album couldve been much tighter than it is, but its still worth a listen.  "Wiggy" starts things off with a high energy track that could  get the party crunk.  It features Madam Dame and fellow Dayton Family  member Bootleg (who kicks a great verse).  "Following a Star"  presents a break from all of the shoot-em-up-gangstafied tracks, but still  fails to measure up to such Dayton Family classics as "Oxydol"  and "Thru a Thang."  To his credit, Shoe has one of the hardest  flows in rap today, but his flow cant shine when its held back by lame  beat/lame hook disease.  Overall, this album leaves you wanting more of the  old "Whats On My Mind" & "F.B.I." days, which we  will hopefully get back with the soon release of the new Dayton Family  album.      ',nonspam
' A105S56ODHGJEK	B00000I8BP	December 7, 1999	1	1	4.0	TDFs Bootleg delivers a very solid solo debut	 Straight outta Flint, MI comes the Dayton Familys Bootleg.  The tightest track on this is "Sideways," on which I.D. (Bootleg) flips his flow and Madam Dame drops a solid verse.  This is a great track.  99% of  this album is pure gangsta, but "Fly Away" is a smooth track  which gives you something to smoke to (if thats your preference).   "No Future," a remix of MC Breeds "Aint No Future in your  Frontin," features Breed himself.  Even Rass Kass makes an appearance  on "Sophisticated Thugs." This album has its weak points, but  still its a MUST for gangster rap fans.      ',nonspam
' A105S56ODHGJEK	B00001QGPS	December 7, 1999	0	0	4.0	Meth/Red deliver a sure hit	 What do you get when two of the best artists in hip-hop join forces? A bangin album, thats what.  "Blackout" succeeds in just about every level.  "Cereal Killer," produced by RZA, is absolutely  NUTS--Literally, as a voice says "This is the sound of a cow" and  you hear a coyote howling out.  It comes complete with a simple, yet dark  and entertaining beat and Meth and Red with some of their best dark lyrics.   "Y.O.U," another standout track, features Redman doing his best  Big Pun impersonation on his second verse, and the "How High"  remix ends the album on a HIGH (ahem) note.  The times the album doesnt  succeed are on the tracks where Meth & Red think just the fact theyre  on a track together makes it good. These are few and far between, but they  do occur. Overall, though, this is a very good album, and a recommended  buy.      ',nonspam
' A105YVLAZNYQUU	B000EMGAOY	May 17, 2006	1	1	5.0	SUPERSTAR	 My words cannot properly give explanation to this amazing double-album. I have listened to it completely now about 6 times, and each listen brings new favorites and melodies sticking in my head. Its really too much for my mind to understand how these 28 songs are so good. I was worried that a double album would mean one good albums worth of songs with a ton of filler crap.   Thankfully I couldnt be more wrong. Its hard to understand how these guys seemingly get better and better as musicians over the years. Pretty much for 20 years now, every new RHCP album becomes my favorite and this is no exception. These albums bleed integrity and genius and I feel privileged to hear them.   These songs weave into beautiful sounds and powerful melodies. The one thing that absolutely blows me away is how these guys have become masters of melody and chorus. Simply genius and they get better and better at it with each passing album.  The highlights for me are too numerous too mention, but I really enjoy any time John sings backup - his voice is transcendental. John and Flea are virtuosos on their guitars. Anthony has never sounded better, and Chad pounds the skins perfectly. Freaking amazing!  I think I like MARS a bit better but really it might change any given day. These guys are insane talents, and each member brings their A game.   Thankfully this band still makes music and we are all fortunate to be able to enjoy them. Their last tour absolutely blew me away and I cant wait to see them live again this year. This double-album is really so good it is mind numbing.      ',spam
' A105YVLAZNYQUU	1401307450	November 28, 2005	12	14	4.0	Not good times boys	 Just finished reading this book and I am still feeling uneasy. This story reveals some shocking truths about a band I have loved for almost two decades. I had no idea that Kiedis was such a junkie and a self-centered jerk. Right from early childhood, Kiedis lived for instant gratification and anyone who stood in his way was bullied or beaten. His drug-dealing father left Anthony to raise himself amidst the lunacy of their household, so Anthony became a kid who took what he wanted. In most respects, Kiedis never grew into an adult - he perpetually lives as a child who takes what he wants regardless of the consequences.   I knew he had dabbled in drugs - or so I thought - but I was shocked to read that Kiedis is a full-on junkie. Nothing glamorous, just straight out a skid row junkie. The only difference between him and regular bums is that Kiedis somehow managed to have periods where he could work with his band, sometimes sober but often times not.   For most of his life he has no fixed address, no bank account, and his daily goal is to get high. I dont know how he managed to live like this and A) never get arrested and B) look healthy in the public eye. Kiedis talks about wasting away and being a living skeleton but he never appeared that way in videos, promos, tour clips, etc. In fact he always came across as the healthy one of the band.    Also had no idea that the band members barely talk(ed) to one another - they always came off as best friends but apparently that ended years and years ago. The way Kiedis tells it - these guys just happen to rock out but their friendships stopped being close long ago.  The book is very detailed with most of Anthonys life, going over all his drug abuse and sexual encounters. But then the book gets very general and almost skims over the sober years since John rejoined the band. I wish there was more to read about how the Chillis make their music and how Kiedis lives his life now.  It baffles me that a band that I have loved for so long has so many awful problems. How was Kiedis able to contribute to the band when he was junked out in crack hotels for days / weeks at a time? I dont get it. After reading this book, I feel deflated. Kiedis is lucky to be alive and AIDS free. Other than that, it is a mystery that the RHCP have been able to make such incredible music. By this account, they should have imploded years ago.

' A105YVLAZNYQUU	B000002JR8	November 4, 2005	3	3	5.0	Far beyond other bands	 This is the album that singularly changed my opinion on Pantera. Up to this point I was not really a fan of the band. I bought Cowboys From Hell and I thought `ehhhhh.  I bought Vulgar Display of Power and was immediately impressed that Pantera was heavier than on CFH. But something didnt quite click for me. Even still - I like Vulgar but I skip through songs and I dont hold it up to this masterpiece.  Far Beyond Driven is freaking tremendous. Dimebag reaches new heights on his riffery - and its hard to comprehend how good some of these songs are. Phil becomes the man - a screaming, growling entity that lays his mind bare with some of the most intense self-examining lyrics around. Phil stops trying to sing and in doing so, he scream himselfs into one of the best vocalists in metal.   The first time I heard `Shedding Skin my brain exploded. To this day, that song breeds something primal in me and makes me want to destroy. Thats the beauty of Pantera - you cannot deny their power and their energy.    The band simply gels as one complete pulse of metal - and they make it seem easy!         ',spam
' A105YVLAZNYQUU	0743264452	November 4, 2005	5	6	3.0	The books is like peanut butter	 It sort of sticks to everything. Im not sure if this even makes sense, but then again I am not sure if this book is even good. I read the book summary and the scanned pages online and I thought it would be a cool book revisiting the life and deaths of various rock stars. I imagined that Chuck would delve into the history of these stories as only he could - then summarize with some grandiose statement about how it is better to die as a rock star because you cant put out any bad albums when you are dead.  I couldnt be more wrong. Sure Chuck takes a road trip to different places where rock stars have died and yes there are some funny anecdotes along the way, but mostly this book is about Chuck and his inability to maintain a good relationship with a woman. I didnt buy `this book. I wanted to read how Layne Staleys death impacted people. I wanted to read about how / why he died. I wanted Chuck to elaborate on the cultural significance of Alice in Chains.  I wanted to know why people think Kurt Cobain was murdered.  I wanted some expose and insight into these various lives and deaths.  I wanted all these things and more.   SO I feel cheated. If the book was marketed as a self-reflection of lost and missing love then I would not have read it. No matter that I enjoy Chucks wit, and his unique cultural slants - I still would not have read a book centered on love.   This book does have thoughts on rock stars and death but instead of elaborating on these people and the places he travels, Chuck becomes introspective and self-analytical. So in other words, Chuck could have wrote this book about his normal 14 days living in New York and marketed it to suggest he knows something about women. Instead, Chuck takes a road trip and uses that as a false pretense to sell a story.  On the plus side - I laughed out loud a bunch of times because only Chuck can make such unique cultural observations.  So is this book good? I dont know - just as Chuck claims he isnt qualified to live in New York - I dont think I am qualified to judge this book as good or bad. I do know that it wasnt the book I intended to read so to that end I was disappointed.       ',nonspam
' A105YVLAZNYQUU	B000002P24	November 3, 2005	2	3	4.0	Amazing Gem	 As a whole, this album is ultimately not so great. There are a lot of throw-away songs and some goofy spoken stuff. But there are some damn cool songs and moments of genuine inspiration. More than anything though I recommend this album because of Boss DJ. This songs is so good it is hard to put into words. The first time I heard this song I think I hit replay about 20 freaking times. And everytime I hear it now, it takes me to a different place. It is so simple yet so amazing - and it showcases the beauty of Sublime - Brad and his guitar. Damn this song is good!      ',nonspam

I read someone complaining that this album is too heavy or something? WTF? Are you insane? If you want lame ass melodies and wimp music then go elsewhere.   This album freaking kicks in you in head the second it begins, and doesnt let up until the last fade out. It is 100% aggression.  All the songs rule and they all have fantastic riffs and vocals. No awful nu-metal crap and no ballads.  Listening to this album makes my heart skip and it makes me want to fight - which is exactly what it should do.  Pantera should be proud of 3 things:  1. Their albums got HEAVIER with each successive release. This is almost unheard of considering how many metal bands sell-out, wimp out or change styles.  2. Pantera leaves a legacy of pure metal, and this last album stands up perhaps the best work of their careers.  3. They never compromised or sold-out. Period.  Sadly, Dimebag is gone but he will always be the soul of one of the most powerful bands to ever exist. RIP Darrell      ',nonspam
' A105YVLAZNYQUU	B00005JO14	June 27, 2005	6	11	1.0	VERY DISAPPOINTING	 First off I am a GIANT George Romero fan and I absolutely love the previous DEAD movies. My favorites (in order) would be Day of the Dead, Night of the Living Dead (1990 remake), Dawn of the Dead, Dawn of the Dead (2004 remake), Night of the Living Dead (original).  I have seen the entire zombie collection of Romero and Romero inspired movies and therefore my expectations for this movie where very high. NOBODY does zombie movies like Romero and nobody ever will. Land of the Dead falls shy of the incredible movie making that Romero is known for. The previous DEAD movies, although all different, had one thing in common; a zombie movie with an intricate plotline, elaborate character development, and scathing social commentary. This movie has none of the above.   Considering Romeros previous works, Land of The Dead has no foundation of story line, plot or characters. There is nothing that endears us to the characters and therefore there is nothing endearing about this movie. Because we dont know anything about the characters the audience never empathizes with the `good guys - or roots against the `bad guys. The previous Romero movies ALWAYS centered on the characters and the social commentary- the zombies and gore were just cool extras. This movie is focused on looking cool rather than delivering a movie of substance.   The basic premise of this movie is some `smart zombies attack a secure city. Why are the zombies smart? Dont know ( we have to assume that all of these zombies got independently smart like Bub in Day of the Dead I guess).  Why are there people in a skyscraper? Dont know. The `villain (poorly played by Dennis Hopper - or is it poorly written by Romero?) runs the skyscraper but Romero never explains the background story to us. All we know is that Hopper was rich and he set up walls around the city and somehow took over the area. Normally this lack of development is not a problem, but for someone of Romeros pedigree - it is inexcusable to gloss over the details as witnessed here.  The audience is left to imagine that some rich upper class people just took over a skyscraper and somehow enacted unchallenged authority over the poor working class slums. We get it - rich vs poor. But guess what George - this social satire is weak like wet tissue paper and holds as much weight. The rich people live in relative comfort and happiness (or so we assume) while the poor live in the streets below. We dont actually know much about either social class because the movie shows very little in the lives of these people. For all we know, the people run moonshine to Hazzard County during the day.   The hero of the movie (I forget his name) never reveals his past or his connection with anyone. Only that he wants to escape to Canada because there is nothing there. Are you kidding me? This joke is so over played it has become embarrassing. For Romero to resort to such ridiculous `jokes should warn you of the effort he put into this movie and its story.   The quasi-hero of the movie played by John Leguizamo is bitter and angry at the rich guy because the rich dude refused to sell him an apartment in the skyscraper. Why you ask? - because he doesnt fit the WASP requirements. So Mr. Leguizamo decides to blow up the city with a super bat mobile or whatever the machine is called - and is labeled a `terrorist by Hopper. Sounds like a joke right? You might be thinking to yourself `a kid in Grade 9 could write this kind of plot ` - well you would be right.  The zombies are intelligent and can reason. They also use weapons to attack. Why? This is ridiculous at best. Case in point - the main zombie scares Dennis Hopper into his car, fills the car with gasoline, then walks outside to get a grenade or something and rolls it back towards the gasoline filled car. Yah yippee lets cheer that some unknown bad guy gets blown up by a smart and vengeful zombie. Wow just bad.  Sure the gore is fantastic, and the zombies have some cool looking attacks - but this had been perfected in the previous DEAD movies. The real strength of Romero is his ability to satire societal problems into believable characters and amazing story telling. This movie has NONE of this. I was very disappointed with this movie - I find it hard to believe that Romero wrote this movie at all. There is absolutely nothing that connects this movie with any of his previous DEAD efforts. The social satire is gone, the character development is non-existent, and the plot is horrible. I really REALLY wanted to like this movie and was bitterly disappointed in a movie 20 years in the making. I hope the DVD has an additional 95 minutes of real Romero footage because thats the only way this movie can be redeemed.       ',nonspam
' A105YVLAZNYQUU	B000634DCW	June 21, 2005	6	112	1.0	UGGHHH	 Craptacular and boring. The cinematography and special effects are well done but the story is dullsville. And what is up with everyone who is claiming that Rudy is such a great actor? All he did was act tired - WOW give him the Oscar now.   I have no idea why these films or books are so popular... are people that disillusioned with life that they need hobbits and dragons to make themselves feel good? I dont care that it took 25 years or whatever to make these films and Peter Jackson is regarded as a genius. This film is boring and lame - just like the first two movies. And its also non-sensical, case in point: the flying dragon things and the super tough mean guy were supposedly the toughest, meanest things in the whole world. Well some chick kills the dragon in like 2 seconds and the tough guy in like 3 seconds. WHY? The movie doesnt explain at all how the good guys are suddenly all-powerful and cant be defeated. Anyway I give this movie a 1 because I couldnt care less about some mystical world and some dumb ring.       ',nonspam

Elf works because Will Farrell is a comedy genius, and the story is just different enough to create a feel-good experience. Elf is not going to win any awards or probably even show up on any Best Movie lists - but if you are looking for a good holiday movie with some laughs then Elf is your best bet in years. Also this is a great movie for kids. In fact I think the target audience is kids as there are no adult-jokes that come to mind at all.      ',nonspam

A total slap in the face to the Hollywood block-buster garbage we see every summer -- Rushmore demands more of you. Not for teenagers or dimwits - they wont get it.

Most people revere this album as some kind of hallowed gem and they are correct. The first COC album to be dominated by Peppers songwriting and singing - it showcases a talent in music that few can match. Its like Pepper comes from some super-planet of music - where maybe the only other inhabitant is Tony Iommi or something.   But this album also makes it VERY clear that Mike, Woody, and Reed are monsters in their own right. They collectively create something that oozes virtuosity. Each player is a master of their sound and instrument and it all comes together in some hazy dreamlike brilliance.  This album is required material. After countless spins - my fav song is `Pearls Before Swine. That rumbling bass line and the amazing blast into the hook is unbelievably good. WOW!       ',spam
' A105YVLAZNYQUU	B000002BJ1	April 28, 2005	2	5	5.0	REAL music	 Lets get one thing straight - COC does not sound anything like those losers in Metallica. I have no idea what people are hearing when they compare COC to the Met camp. Put it this way, COC is a class above and beyond. On this album, the tunes are heavy deep southern fried sabbath doom. It a shame that COC is compared to Metallica at all because the sounds are nowhere alike. Comparing the two is ridiculous - and lets me state for the record that COC creates timeless music that somehow seems to be getting better with each album. While Metallicas best days are long past.  Woody delivers a killer performance! Some of the solos are just ridiculous. I cant figure out how that SOUND was achieved. And Mike blows freaking insane grooves over every inch of this record. He is such an amazing bass-player and he never gets the proper respect from the music press.  And finally Pepper. What can you say about this man that people havent heard? The dude is sick man. He just oozes talent and he cements COC as one of the greatest bands there will ever be.  I personally like Deliverance and Americas Volume Dealer better but Wiseblood still kicks major ass. Really - this band is without peer. Simply put, if you like Deliverance - you will like this album.      ',spam
' A105YVLAZNYQUU	B0007X9UJC	April 28, 2005	2	4	5.0	COC Delivers yet again	 This album takes you on a journey, expands your mind, and makes you realize that COC are one of the greatest bands that have ever existed. While other bands have struggled with their identity, their music and their integrity, COC have consistently put out amazing records for the past 14 years. Dont get me wrong, the 80s discs are good in their own right - but COC did not become epic until Pepper joined the band.  Every track is amazing - and dont expect to be bludgeoned into submission with some kind of ridiculous Nu-Metal garbage. COC delivers music that is timeless. It doesnt matter what year this album was made - it will always sound like COC and it will always sound incredible. How many other bands can say that? And its not like the band stays stagnant with this record, in fact this album pushes their music all over the place.   Woody, Mike, and Pepper are freaking amazing! I cant understand how they dont receive more appreciation and sales. Bonus info: I saw their tour w/ Motorhead and they blew me away. Woody is the most-underappreciated guitarists in metal today. His solo work and tone is unreal!  Mike was absolutely killer and Pepper is one the coolest singer/guitarists of all time.  The bottom line is that COC is absolutely one of the greatest bands around. If you dont like COC or this album, you are ignorant.      ',spam
' A105YVLAZNYQUU	1401300065	February 25, 2005	2	3	4.0	Inside Jay Mohr	 First off I am a HUGE Jay Mohr fan. The dude makes me laugh so hard its ridiculous. However in my opinion, Jays comedy works when the interaction is just YOU and HIM. Therefore his stand up routine and radio appearances absolutely KILL.  Unfortunately, I cant say the same for Jays acting gigs, and TV roles such as SNL. The SNL environment pretty much isolated Jay from his strengths - improv, impersonations, and feeding off an audience to get laughter. Some SNL brass recognized his talent and gave him a job, but the SNL machine pretty much chewed and spit Jay out. SNL works as a very disorganized hierarchy where the best ideas or talent does not necessarily rise to the top. And Jay flat out did not function within that environment.  Jay provides insight into the SNL machine and how it runs, so you gotta like that. Plus it is well written and easy to read. You could sit down and read this book in one evening for sure.  Anyway, the book is a good read - nothing great or mind blowing, but if you are a fan of Jay or SNL it is a must read!       ',nonspam
' A105YVLAZNYQUU	0786863390	February 22, 2005	1	2	3.0	Messy	 Sometimes good, sometimes great but overall this book is VERY laid back and sort of half baked. Roth writes with a Zen persona - so some stories dont really head anywhere and some anecdotes fade out before they should.  Some of the time it works and certain chapters are funny, informative, and entertaining. Other times the Zen man doesnt deliver the goods.   Overall the book is a must read for fans of classic Van Halen and DLR because there really is nothing else out there. Unfortunately, there is very little insight to the Van Halen machine at he height of their success.  One additional note - my book is completely falling apart.

Those of you who cant appreciate this album are weak minded fools.  Angel Dust transcends music and song writing. The pure passion and emotion that bleeds from this album makes me understand that music is the ultimate expression of creating art.  This album was a great huge `slack off to the commercial machine of MTV and radio and for that very reason alone it can be considered genius. FNMs previous album enjoyed way too much mainstream success and the band followed up with an album that reeked of integrity, and pushed the boundaries of music.  Every song is unique, every song is radically amazing. Years later I still marvel at the symphony of sound and power the band created on this majestic album. From the opening power of Land of Sunshine to the final notes of Midnight Cowboy - this album takes you on a passage through all limitations of genre. Every instrument and sound are perfect. Every band member reaches their peak as a continuation of one unique wall of substance.  And the lyrics - unbelievable!!  Pure and simple -  some of the greatest lyrics ever spoken by man.   Mere labels and categories cannot apply to this band nor this album. Is it metal? Is it funk? Is it alternative? These categories are meaningless. It is Angel Dust and nothing less would do.

I guess I struggle with where these songs are going - I mean their last album Sabotage was unequivocal genius and somehow they write this as a follow-up?  Some of the songs work - `You Wont Change Me, `All Moving Parts (Stand Still), `Shes Gone, `Dirty Women.   One of the songs has a cool riff section but quickly changes tempo and arrangement to something bad (Gypsy).   Two songs are awful - `Back Street Kids, `Rock & Roll Doctor  And the piano ballad is something akin to a Paul McCartney homage (Its Alright) - so you might like it but I just dont see it as Sabbath.  Overall, the record is still strong songwriting - but it finally shows that Sabbath are human after all. Up till now, they kept making greater and greater albums but with this one the slide backwards.  On a plus side - the production on Ozzys vocals is freaking amazing. Arguably the sickest vocals he ever recorded.      ',nonspam

On the other hand the searing lyrics and vocals tear up your mind as you bare witness to the mental anguish of this band. This record is unapologetic with its first hand account of drug abuse and the disarray it creates. However, the songs are unquestionably a success because they are so raw, genuine, and intense.  Anyone who loves heavy music needs to own this album. Some songs are so powerful, you wonder how the sound doesnt tear through your speakers. Seriously, there are some moments in music history that change things forever. Black Sabbath did it with Master of Reality and Alice in Chains does it here.  The first time I heard this album, my brain was obliterated by its intense focus on HEAVY. Not spastic or noise or hardcore - just freaking beautiful. Sweltering guitar, blazing vocals.

But I must admit that I was a bit disappointed with the lack of detail or dirt that was uncovered. For example the book writes something about a night of drinking and trouble. Well I wanna know what happened, who was there, what sex acts were performed etc. Maybe I am expecting too much after reading Motley Crues The Dirt.   In any event, the book definitely shows that Sabbath were a regular blue-collar bunch who never took themselves too seriously. Some cool photos and cool stories. One comment - Bill Ward quickly goes from looking healthy to looking sickly in the band photos. Man - he needed someone to help him back in the day. He looks like the walking dead or something      ',nonspam
' A105YVLAZNYQUU	B000002KET	November 23, 2004	1	2	5.0	Superb	 This album is widely recognized as Sabbaths best work EVER. At various times I have agreed with that sentiment - but finally I have decided that it comes in at number 2 behind Sabotage.   Nevertheless, this album is a life-changing event. Sabbath could have released the title track alone and it would still be considered a classic album. Sabbath holed up in a castle, threw out all previous conventions they created and uniformly created this colossal amount of metal.  Hidden favorite is `Looking For Today - an overlooked song that embodies the amazing Sabbath in yet another new musical venture.   You need to but this album - from the cover art to the last seconds of play time, you will not be disappointed.        ',nonspam

It is a masterwork of epic proportions.  Perhaps more than anything - this album cements Black Sabbath as pure musical geniuses. They reach down into the very pits of their souls - and summon a work of art so majestic, it defies suitable descriptions.   At its simplest level - this album is unique, powerful, intense, complex - it is everything you could ever hope for from music. It is the amalgamation of four people and their ideas into one collective consciousness. It is beyond simple titles or description. It is not brilliant - rather it is BRILLIANCE.      ',nonspam

Vol 4 is in and of itself brilliant. It stands alone as maybe the first `collection of songs for the Sab Four. The three prior albums had an unspoken theme or feel to the tunes and Vol 4 strays from that comfort zone. Not that this is a bad thing - indeed Vol 4 is simply devastating.  Lose yourself in the mood changes that unfolds with this colossal album. I must admit that `Changes is weak - not at all a Sab song I enjoy but nevertheless this album is essential.   Basically  - Sabbath moved forward in their metal progression. Once again they show that they alone are capable of creating something so meaningful.       ',nonspam

Well the answer becomes sickeningly obvious soon enough - they create an even more powerful sound and attitude.   Are you kidding me? Right from the first seconds of `Sweet Leaf - Sabbath show the world they are the innovators of the heaviest sound ever. The first 2 albums were metal and all - but they were blues based and Sabbath was still finding themselves. On this 3rd outing - the heavens opened and out poured the heaviest blobs of doom imaginable.  Pure timeless boundless heaviness. Every second of this album is perfect. Inventors of stoner metal, doom metal, heavy metal  - every metal. Sabbath is beyond the shackles of mankind on this album  - they have progressed to some other-worldy existence of perfection.

Im sure its the best-selling Sabbath record ever made and pretty much everyone I know has it - even if its the only Sabbath album they own.  First off, its not their best work. Super classic `War Pigs is amazing, as is `Paranoid, `Planet Caravan and `Hand of Doom. The rest of the songs work well except for `Iron Man. Sure the riff is the stuff of legends but I have always hated the song. It is just too goofy - and the story or lyrics are weak.   The cover art is laughable - couldnt they have something better??

Jim Carrey ( up till this movie) was only known for wacky - goofy comedy. And this movie is leaps and bounds above that crap. If you want lame - childish - Pet Ventura junk then stay away. But if you can appreciate smart humor and good writing then this is a blast. The whole concept of Cable Guy is based on a man who will do anything to be liked - even though everything he does is over the top and annoying. The two scenes that always kill me: 1) he dresses up like Freddie Mercury and beats up Owen Wilson in the bathroom. 2) He mauls the dude in the basketball game in slo-mo, then eventually dunks the ball and breaks the glass after hanging on the rim and falls STRAIGHT down.

Puppets is a metal classic, period. Follows the same formula as RTL but remains fresh and new. Permanent godly status ensues.  Best song? Tough to say, because this album is so over the top good, but I have to go with Orion. The second instrumental they recorded, and WAY better than Call of Ktulu ( which for some weird reason is experiencing some kind of resurgence in popularity). Orion is genuis. I dont have an incredible background in classical music - but to me Orion is as good as anything ever written. The power, emotion, and beauty of Orion is second to none - and in fact, it is an even greater song because of the lack of lyrics. Orion is perfection.

Jerry Cantrell has crafted a fantastic record that provides a soundscape of melody. If you are looking for heavy Alice in Chains you will be disappointed.

These same people are losers that complain about this album. GET A GRIP clowns - you are the same people that complain how COC used to be `hardcore or `punk. COC create music for people with intelligence, thats it - DEAL WITH IT!   This album absolutely smokes! Every song reaffirms the band at the top of their collective skills. Granted, the production is not their best but the songs speak for themselves. I would have preferred that the production was a bit more raw - just like the live cd/dvd. Regardless, then music is something COC alone could craft and nobody in music today comes close to matching these rock monsters.

SKEFFINGTON certainly has its pleasures, particularly in its excellent first half. Fanny Trellis is a charming, silly society beauty who adores her neer-do-well snobbish brother, the infelitiously named Tripppy Trellis. To save him from going to jail for embezzlement, she encourages the suit paid her by his wealthy self-made boss, Job Skeffington (superbly played by Claude Rains). Although Fanny likes Job very much and treats him mostly with kindness, she is incapable of loving anyone other than herself or Trippy, and she chastely encourages the continued attentions of her other society suitors; eventually Trippys death drive Fanny and Job apart, until they are reconciled by pictures end.  Davis affecting a very charming and childike breathy voice to play Fanny, which wound up being one of her most memorable roles; although she is almost never consciously cruel, she brings great pain to her husband and to her daughter by her inability to love them. The film allows for great fashion-plate outfits for Davis from Orry-Kelly spanning the deacdes from 1914 to the time the film was made, although the costumnes (like the film itself) take a real downturn in the Roaring Twenties when Fanny is called upon to wear flapper outfits and visit speakeasies with gangsters. The film becomes tediously melodramatic in its later sequences when Fanny must be pushed by nemesis for being so vain and thus she contracts diphtheria, which ravages her face; although the makeup Davis then affects to make herself look old and "dilapidated" (Fannys term) amusingly anticipates her infamous later look as Baby Jane Hudson,  she begins wearing ridiculously dowdy costumes with lace collars even though her character is supposed to be trying to pass as a beauty still. Naturally Hollywood demanded that Daviss Fanny not only be punished for being a abad mother and wife but that she also be redeemed: the final sequence with Fanny and Job reconciling is pretty hilariously over-the-top. Yet both Davis and Rains seem to surmount the material by giving genuinely affecting performances.      ',nonspam

The main characters inner life is almost entirely missing from this film version, and although you can understand Marshalls reasons for keeping the voiceover narration to a minimum he needed to compensate by divulging in some other way why Chiyo thinks what she thinks and does what she does. With the exception of the extraordinarily gifted Chinese actress Li Gong as the heroines spiteful nemesis Hatsumomo, most of the major roles seem singularly miscast: the lovely Maggie Cheung seems too old to play Mameha, and Ziyi Zhang is pretty much a beautiful blank as Chiyo.

Frank Baum, its a very toughminded philosophical and political novel brilliantly told (and it improves in the re-reading). He has been beleaguered with requests for a sequel since the first novels release, but unfortunately this follow-up, chronicling the further adventures in Oz of the Wicked Witchs possible heir, Liir, following the death of Elphaba and the departure from Oz of both the Wizard and Dorothy, doesnt seem to have much of a point to it. Even darker and more cynical than its predecessor, SON OF A WITCH seems a re-telling of the Waste-Land myth, with Liir acting as Parsifal to the Amfortas of the Winkie Princess Nastoya; but there seems to be little point to his actions, and the book suffers greatly from the fact that it touches much more tangentially on Baums Oz books than its predecessor did. Though Tip and Mobi (and her four-horned cow) and the Hungry Tiger make the briefest of appearances, Maguires book seems to make little sense when read against the events of THE MARVELOUS LAND OF OZ--which makes the whole revisionist project seem a bit pointless. But the tale does showcase Maguires bracing philosophical cynicism and his strong narrative drive.The novel does seem to position itself open for another sequel at its ending, so we can hope that there will be more to come that will make sense out of what is a promising but disappointing follow-up to the excellent WICKED.

His heroine, Sayuri (Chiyo), is also neither like Dickenss David Copperfield or Austens Fanny Price is that she is much more proactive and is at times even devious, but she shares their deprived upbringings and victimizations by childhood nemeses--and, like them, becomes recognized for her true worth as she matures.

Its a mystery involving a mercenary booksellers attempts to find out the truth about a chapter of THE THREE MUSKETEERS written in Alexandre Dumass original hand and also a legendary text of demonology in a series of European cities: Madrid, Sintra, Paris and Toledo. There are some truly cringeworthy "erotic" passages, and some highly florid similes that might have been penned by Mickey Spillane, and the narration by a secondary character seems pretty unconvincing and forced. But for the most part the mystery itself is a fun puzzle and many of its characters are fairly original. if anything, the book is best for pointing readers to the intelligent European potboilers of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries penned by Dumas, Hugo, Sabatini, and Christie, all of which are lovingly evoked (and which provide clues to the books ending).

Kelly was extraordinarily handsome (especially in profile), and his attractiveness coupled with his athleticism makes his dArtagnan tremendous fun to watch, especially in his duels. He was never much of an actor, however, and his director George Sidney unfortunately encouraged him to indulge in such embarrassing antics as flipping on his back and wiggling his legs in the air to show sexual arousal when he spies on the fair Constance (the awesomely unlovely June Allyson) undressing. Except for Van Heflin as the melancholy Athos, acting, indeed, is not this productions strong suit: Robert Coote and Gig Young have practically nothing to say as Aramis and Porthos; Frank Morgan plays Louis XIII exactly like he played Professor Marvel in THE WIZARD OF OZ; and Angela Lansbury struts around looking gorgeous and inexpressive as Anne of Austria. And then there is Lana Turner as Milady. Ideally cast in physical terms, Turner works hard at her big scenes pretending to be dying in the Duke of Buckinghams castle; she is perhaps much more memorable inexpertly executing her little bits of stage business while other characters talk around her, such as attending to her makeup. Shes pretty unintentionally hilarious, as are the productions odd uses for location footage: while the Musketeers gallop at frenetic space to England, they seem to move from Monument Valley to Big Sur in just one cut, and neither locale seems even passably convincing as Normandy. And at one point Sidney uses what seems to be a brookside Cape Cod as a seventeenth-century inn. But it is almost impossible to dislike the film given its high energy and spirits. Everything moves so lickety-split that the whole movie passes by quickly and painlessly.      ',nonspam

Basically a Cinderella story set during the 30s, Watsons novel concerns a dowdy governess sent by mistake by her agency to the home of a glamorous and dithering nightclub singer, who comes to rely upon Miss Pettigrew to straighten out her love life. Miss Pettigrew not only rises to the challenge (much to her own surprise), but undergoes a makeover and finds some romance for her own life as well. While undeniably slim (and purposefully so), the novel is just about irresistible: it plays upon the same fantasy as Jane Austens MANSFIELD PARK, the fantasy of being not only loved but also needed. Curiously, the trappings of glamour in this novel come not from the world of the wealthy and titled (as per usual in British fiction from this era, as in the novels of Waugh and Nancy Mitford) but from a world envisioned in American film: the world of night clubs, self-made men, and cocaine-dabbling gigolos.

Eccentric, funny, intelligent and lively, one became a one became a novelist (Nancy), one became a fascist (Diana), one became a countrywoman (Pamela), one became a Nazi (Unity), and one became a duchess (Deborah).

The memoir gives a fascinating account of what it was like to live as what her sisters dismissingly term "a ballroom pink" in the Thirties, but is most memorable, of course, for its detailing of her sisters hilarious observations about class, snobbery, sex and one another: when it is announced their King is going to marry an American with the unprepossesing name of Wallis Simpson, for example, the sisters refuse to believe it ("That cannot be her real Christian name!").

Twice these books have been the basis for miniseries from the BBC, and the latest and most expensive version (from 2001) is avilable on DVD. The characters and observations about class and eccentricity are so funny almost no version of these novels can miss, and this adaptation is blessed not only with sumptuous production values but a wonderful gallery of BBC stars, from Alan Bates as the splenetic Lord Alconleigh to the Sheila Gish as the iron-willed gorgon Lady Montdore. Of the three young women cast as the central characters galloping off in pursuit of love, however, only Rosamund Pike fully succeeds as Fanny (paradoxically the least fleshed out of the three characters in Mitfords books), whom she plays as a dreamy and naive rose; Megan Dodds does not do enough with Polly Hampton, who marries against her mothers wishes, and Elisabeth Dermot-Walsh plays the key role of Linda Radlett as mostly frivolous rather than as the rueful romantic Mitford imagined. It also seems to have been a mistake to tell the stories of both novels concurrently rather than sequentially, since THE PURSUIT OF LOVE becomes darker as it proceeds whereas the original LOVE IN A COLD CLIMATE becomes frothier; the adapter, Deborah Moggach, does not adjust well for these changes in tone when they run against one another.

' A106016KSI0YQ	0140161198	September 17, 2004	1	1	4.0	Beautiful (despite its obvious debts)	 This is one of the finest novels to emerge from the Second World War, and greatly deserves to be back in print. Mollie Panter-Downess debts in this "day in the life" of a family (a father, daughter, and, most crucially, a wife) in a small village outside of London during the year after the cessation of war activities was clearly influenced by Katherine Mansfields great story "At the Bay" and--even more saliently--by Virginia Woolfs MRS. DALLOWAY, in form, content, and tone. (Key phrases like "The war is over," here as in Woolf uttered by a wealthy woman past her sexual prime in relief, are directly taken from the Woolf novel.) But despite its derivativeness this is a masterful little novel, and should be accorded a special placed in the literature of the 1940s. Mollie Panter-Downes really could write, and her characters really come alive off the page. The descriptions of the English countryside on a hot day when the world seems still even though the class structure is forever changing are something to relish.       ',nonspam

George Pal went all out on the effects, and came up with a fascinating "triad"-based design for the Martians and their machines, and the sound effects (the distinctive sound of the ray guns is something that immediately evokes the films) are spectacular. The real triumph of the film, however, is in the prankish cruelty of the Martians: they seem to delight in attacking people at their most vulnerable (and also seem a bit sexually curious about the heroine). This cheerful maliciousness was a huge influence on Tim Burtons MARS ATTACKS! in the mid-90s.  The film is perhaps too ponderous and unsubtle really to reach the A-list of 50 scifi films: theres nothing so subtle here as in the original INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, for example. But you still get the pleasures of downtown Los Angeles being devastated, and of Cedric Hardwickes awesomely portentous narration.      ',nonspam

EVERY EYE is one of the most beautifully written books in their series; Isobel Englishs gift for narrative description (particularly for landscape and for fabrics) is superb. The story initially seems to be out of Caroline Blackwood territory, with its heroines repeating complaints about the maternal figures in her life (particularly her aunt); but as the novel unfolds it moves far beyond that, and its deft shuttlings back between the heroines present (her honeymoon in Ibiza) and her past seem miraculous. Cinema is one of the places where we are best used to such shifts, but theres little filmic in Englishs technique--her talents are thoroughly those of the novelistic. The gorgeousness of the prose and narrative drive allow you to overlook the conventionality of the very guessable "surprise ending."      ',nonspam

This superb collection of her essays shows  her at her shrewdest, on subjects ranging from Eugene ONeill to fashion magazines to Portugal to society and political figures. Famous for her unrelentingly flinty lordliness (memorably and mercilessly caricatured in Randall Jarrells PICTURES FROM AN INSTITUTION), she can be savage in her reviews. When her stinging rebukes are deserved, as in her famous withering critique of Salingers FRANNY AND ZOOEY, theyre a delight, but even when you feel theyre unwarranted or off-target theyre still instructive and illuminating, and are always written with incredible elegance and eloquence. We want the best of the best critics to show, more than anything, a point of view, which McCarthy undoubtedly does: a point of view that is Europhilic, intelligent, self-important, funny, biting, and exceptionally articulate.  This collection is an absolutely beautiful hardcover edition from NYRB that is as delightful to the touch as to the eye. It is an extremely worthy investment.      ',spam

Shes terrific here, and she gets a great haunting opening solo from the caboose of a train and a great entrance into town with the famous "On the Atchison, Topeka, and the Santa Fe," one of the most excitingly staged numbers the Arthur Freed unit ever did (which is saying something). The rest of the film isnt up to Garlands level or the level of those two songs, although the hokey plot--about how the upright and starched Harvey Girls bring such an attractive wholesomeness to the Wild West that all the temptations of sin wilt before them--demonstrates pretty much the MGM moral ethos of the time. One added plus: a very young Angela Lansbury, as Garlands rival for John Hodiak (ugh), looking ravishing in multicolored lace teddies and oversized picture hats.      ',nonspam

This book, which has been  out of print for a few years in the US, is still quite enjoyable, and the cadre of curious characters that populate it are as memorable in their own way as those out of Dickens (to whom Wilson is often compared). There is a kind of creepiness in the latent homophobia of the comic ending (everyone receives his or her just desserts, which means in this case the major gay characters are killed or maimed), but the novel is of a different and earlier time.The description of Ingeborg Middletons hideously frollicsome Nordic Christmas party alone makes the novel worth reading.

Adapted from a pulp novel about a serial killer, the film veers widely from its original source: the murder mystery that sets it off fades very quickly to the background, as the film becomes much more about the volatile relationship between the abusive but romantic screenwriter played by Bogart and the woman he loves (Gloria Grahame, in a very fine performance that makes much of her odd combination of flowerlike beauty and tough will). The films searching exploration of raw emotions combined with its complex use of mise-en-scene only partially obscures the fact that Bogarts performance is quite erratic. Although believably incensed in the final scene, he seems too bored and tired to  be credible driving his car at high speed in a fury or beating up a star football player. Moreover, the initial scenes with Bogart and the murder victim seem from another movie altogether, and you feel cheated when the likeable murder victim turns out to be so irrelevant to the story. This DVD version has a sometimes illuminating, sometimes fatuous short starring Curtis Hanson providing commentary on the film.      ',nonspam

Cheerleaders have become so abused in Hollywood teen films (despite their national popularity) that it takes you a while to realize how straight this film plays it. The best thing it has going for it is Kirsten Dunst, who is as always better than everyone else on screen. In the great beginning pep rally sequence (the films high point, unfortunately, but worthy of repeat viewings), shes almost hypnotically expressive. She doesnt have much of a character to play (nor does anyone else in the film, for that matter), but she works it for all shes got. The film tries to be brave by confronting the idea of how wealthy white students from the suburbs steal the best routines from inner city schools; the racial politics are there, but theyre tiptoed around pretty quietly, as is homosexuality (though its nice to see for once a gay character in a high school film treated in a matter of fact fashion). The film really loses its way midway through in a sequence about a mean choreographer that could have been hilarious but falls completely flat. It only picks up again at the end, with the great final routines at the National finals (which are really something to see).Its rare to see a Hollywood movie that actually could have been better had it been extended and fleshed out, but this is it.

Yet Roger Michells adaptation of "Persuasion" for the BBC is perhaps the most faithful of the many Austen adaptations that followed, and is still simultaneously the best. Like Patricia Rozema in :"Mansfield Park," he brings great intelligence and brings forth certain latent ideas in the text that speak to the era in which he filmed it: he shows the grubbiness of the Regency era, and emphasizes the differences in class relations. But unlike Rozema, Michell has the good sense to trust Austen and allow his heroine to be as quiet and as patient as the author wrote her to be. Amanda Root, with her beautiful undertsanding eyes that speak volumes, is as faithful to Austens conception of the role as could be imagined. The rest of the cast is terrific: Corin Redgrave enjoyed some well deserved praise later in his career for his snobbish and empty headed Sir Walter Elliot, and Phoebe Nicholls is just as good as his eldest daughter (given to fits of pique against her sister Anne). The compositions are also marvelous, with tremendous innovative use being made of the actual Bath and Lyme Regis locations.      ',spam

F. Benson in its breezy depiction of the life among interwar rich ninnies. This novel may attempt for something a little stronger in its attempt to adhere to the Aristotelean unities and its faint note of the tragic, but it doesnt quite pull it off. After all, why should it adhere to the Aristotelean unities, and what does the trragic note matter when the characters are so thin?

' A106016KSI0YQ	1903155231	July 15, 2004	3	3	4.0	A second Voyage Out	 Emma Smith wrote only two novels in the late 40s before she married and put away her typewriter for decades; they were bestsellers and were critically acclaimed, yet they remain today largely forgotten. The Persephone Press has reissued one of them, THE FAR CRY, and like its  central characters it is odd and difficult to appreciate at first but well worth it in the end. Fourteen year-old Tersea is pulled out of school by her cantankerous and dislikeable father to go to India with him simply to spite her mother, from whom her father is estranged and who is coming to England to reclaim her; in India, he hopes to reunite with his other daughter from a previous marriage, the lovely Ruth. For the first hundred pages or so this book is very hard-going: the characters seem not only unlikeable but also unloveable, and you wonder why you put up with them. Like Forster in his rougher early fiction (WHERE ANGELS FEAR TO TREAD and THE LONGEST JOURNEY), which seem among her clearest models, Emma Smith seems intent on showing us the worst side of people: the luxury of a bright and alienated young author, perhaps. But when Teresa and her father get to India, everything changes: their responses to this nation unknown to them show them to be capabnle of stronger sensibilities and reactions then we supposed, and when they arrive at the house of Ruth and her husband in Assam (both of whom are themselves strongly realized characters) we feel we know them much more thoroughly, and Smiths wider precocious pattern makes more sense. It may be objected of this book (as Salman Rushdie objected to Paul Scotts RAJ QUARTET, which four novels this book anticipates in many ways) that Smith uses India only as a backdrop for her Anglo-Indian characters problems, and is content to have the Indians in her novel only play walk-ons in their own country. There is no real answer to such a charge, because Smith is concerned with India mostly in terms of the distance and immensity it implies for central Anglo-Indian family, and what it says about their own problems regarding human contact and friendship. In this the novel seems much like another early Bloomsbury novel, Woolfs THE VOYAGE OUT, which is the clearest of all precursors for this work. But unlike Woolfs imagined South American country, the India Smith uses as the backdrop for her characters Bildungsroman is real, and was really observed, and Smiths powers of description are exceptional. This is not an easy novel to like, but I think it is well worth the effort.      ',nonspam

Although it owes much (too much) to Henry James and E. M. Forster and Edith Wharton, its still a memorable novella, especially in its evocations of a tourists Venice that is more ultimately more recognizable (and sensual) than Manns or Jamess, even if it lacks the other writers intellectual rigor.  Wealthy, attractive Lavinia Johnstone is in Venice with her formidable Boston Brahmin mother after disappoiinting the latter by refusing four estimable suitors; while acting the tourist, she becomes enamored of a handsome gondolier even if she refuses to admit this to herself. She writes a friend for advice, transferring the desire for the gondolier onto a fictitious friend--"Simonetta Perkins"--, all the while denying the truth of her attraction to the gondolier, to her mother, or to herself. How long can Lavinia remain in the closet from her desire, and what should happen if she should venture out? The novella is made all the more fascinating given Hartleys own sexual orientation, which puts the idea of Lavinias masked desire into a different focus.      ',nonspam

But this, the first season of SCTV Network on NBC, is still about as hilarious as television comedy can get, and the first episode shows highlights from the syndicated show, including what is perhaps the funniest game show parody ever done on television, "High Q." One thing that made the cast so great was their universal ability to mimic famous performers, something that comes to a head in their hilarious spoof of "The Lion in Winter." Moreover, they were so good at realizing the best humor results from being true to character: just watch Rick Moranis as Teri Shields gently chiding his daughter during "The Brooke Shields Show," or Levy and OHara as Gene Shalit and Rona Barrett singing "Were a Couple of Swells".

Mr. and Mrs. Helianos are a couple living in Nazi-occupied Athens forced to share their apartment with a melancholy German officer; vaguely mistreated by him, they learn to bear up under their hardships for a good year. Then he leaves for a vacation in Germany and returns behaving suddenly much more gently and kindly towards them, a change of heart that signals disaster for the lives of all of them. The story, inspired by an anecdote told by a Greek freedom fighter to Wescott, is perhaps not as dense as youd like on first reading (there are none of the sort of Jamesian twists we might expect), but the difficult ethical positions of the Helianoses become clearer the more you think about the work later. This short novel is a very sophisticated study of the problems and evils inherent in human sympathy during a time of war.      ',nonspam
' A106016KSI0YQ	B0001US6CI	July 7, 2004	2	3	3.0	Fascinating if a bit aimless	 The problem with biopics is that in the real world events happen to people here and there. There is rarely a driving narrative to real peoples peoples lives. So you watch something like THE REAGANS fascinated by the detail (especially in its portrayal of the Reagan children trying to cope with their closed-off parents), but theres nothing to really be learned from the whole narrative. The Reagans meet and get married, have children; Ronnie runs for governor and then for the presidency four times (twice successfully); he gets shot in office and nearly undone by Iran/Contra, and then they go back to California. Thats it. This miniseries was based on a book about the First Ladies of the US, so Nancy of course figures heavily into it. Judy Davis, inarguably one of the greatest actors living today, would seem born to play the ironwilled Nancy, and she approaches her part with a great deal of intelligence and makes Nancy seem enormously sympathetic even at her most imperious to her husbands staff or at her most firebreating to her children. She even gets to do a musical number, with great panache (Nancys famous rendition of "Second-Hand Rose" for the Gridiron club), and she is allowed one exceptionally poignant scene (her meeting with her senile mother at a retirement home in the mid 80s). James Brolin fares less well: he looks very much like Reagan, and has the mannerisms and the voice down pat (hes even as good a mimic as President Reagan reportedly was), but he does not project the needed vitality. The Reagan children are well portrayed--lonely and needy Michael, upbeat Maureen, angry Patti (Zoie Palmer, in a particularly fine and furious small performance) and practical Ron Jr.--,but you feel they often get shunted off from the main narrative just as they apparently did in real life from their parents all-consuming love relationship and political ambition. Republicans were furious before this miniseries aired about its antipathy towards the Reagans politics, but the only real points it scores against the Reagan administration is in its willful obliviousness to the AIDS crisis.

Oriel Malet,. something of a prodigy herself, wrote this astonishing little biography of Fleming in 1946 at age twenty. Although several biographies of Fleming had been written in the preceding century, and Malets book owes much to Lytton Stracheys QUEEN VICTORIA (particularly in its descriptions of a childs ungovernable temperament), this novelized biography is a little miracle in its own right. Malet doesnt quite get down the way educated Regency Scottish children like Marjory spoke (the invented dialogue is often at odds with Marjorys own archly sophisticated observations in her diary), yet even still malet captured something not only about the involving struggle of a child straining to master language but the odd pitched battle in our souls from those to whom we feel we ought to owe our gravest debts and those whom we truly love the most.

Laskis story centers on frivolous, wealthy Melanie, who lies in recovery from tuberculosis in the months after giving birth. Her doctor allows her to move from her sickbed to an embroidered Victorian chaise-longue she purchased while shopping for her cradle. As she lies upon it, she becomes aware she is no longer in the 1950s but trapped instead in the body of someone else in the High Victorian period--someone oddly familiar... This little novella uses its fantasy framework to expose our relations to ourselves and to memory and to time, and also to analyze the change in conventions for women and behavior from the nineteenth to the twentieth centuries. Its a real forgotten classic, deserving of rediscovery both in the United Kingdom and the USA.      ',spam

The fun of this book is waiting to see how the smaller mysteries will come together, especially when the American professors wife goes missing and a womans body turns up in the river.

Her burnished lapidary prose and her characters extremely aphoristic way of speaking can seem initially offpyutting, but once you realize she knows what shes doing exactly on the level of the sentence you trust her and let her run with it. But Hazzards sense of control at the larger level of plot is less steady. The novel, which describes a huge span of time (25 years) in the lives of two sisters and the people with whom they gather in an academics house in England in the 1950s, is an admirable attempt to cover the arc of many lives over a period of years as they occasionally cross paths in ways as  transcendantly as the astonromical event mentioned in the title; the big narrative surprises at the end seem to undo much of what you thought about the characters before, but since there are so many characters to keep track of you end up feeling more confused and cheated than entranced. You wind up admiring what Hazzard is trying to do but left feeling she couldnt quite pull it off. Some of the ancillary narratives embedded within the larger narrative are first rate, however, and I have to say I am going to read her other novels regardless of my dissatisfactions with this work.

On the other hand, there are many things that make this film worth seeing, particularly the great dialogue and the fine supporting performances by Tina Louise, Nanette Newman, and (especially) Paula Prentiss as the heroines best friend Bobbie. Indeed, there are several parts of the film that are literally unforgettable: Newmans much-quoted "breakdown" at the pool party ("Ill just die if I dont get this recipe!"); Joannas consciousness raising session, with the Wives breathlessly promoting the joys of cleaning products; and, most of all, the great last scene, with the Wives placidly sweeping through the supermarket in their ruffled prairie dresses and sunhats as they patiently push their shopping carts...

For example, "The More You Ruv Someone," is a spoof of the great songs of yearning sung by tertiary characters in later Rodgers and Hammerstein shows (like THE KING AND I or FLOWER DRUM SONG) but is also one of the most beautifully lyrical songs composed for Broadway in a long time. "You Can Be as Loud as the Hell You Want," similarly, is a tribute to the kinds of funky songs from "the Wiz" but is terrific in its own right. And the show is saved from too much self-congratulatory cynicism by a very idealistic and gorgeous final song celebrating helping that would not be out of place on the real "Sesame Street." The cast is terrific, particularly the puppeteers: the adorable John Tartaglia doubling as the freshfaced hero Princeton and the uptight closeted Rod, Stephanie dAbruzzo as the idealistic Kate Monster, and the vampish Lucy, and the hilarious Rick Lyon who uncannily channels Cookie Monster (as "Trekkie Monster") and Ernie (as "Nicky").

Fraser does not whitewash the queens extravagance nor her intellectual limitations nor even her affair with Count Felsen of Sweden, but she also shows that the Austrian-born consort has been unjustly maligned for being excessively Machiavellian (which she was almost incapable of being) and for the Diamond Necklace Affair (where the queen was almost wholly innocent, although she did mismanage her own exoneration). She is also very moving in her descriptions of how Marie Antoinette was a pawn in her mothers dynastic strategies, and perceptive in her explanations of how Louis XVIs sexual awkwardness resulted initially in the queens constant anxiety regarding her inopportunity to provide an heir and then later in her unlucky assumption of the roles usually accorded to the kings mistress.  Fraser writes beautifully, with a strong sense of narrative and character: I found it a hard to stop reading. The color photo inserts are also quite well chosen. My only strong gripe would be the inadequate genealogical charts Fraser provides, which is especially unfortunate given the multiple (and confusing) titles assumed by the kings and queens immediate Bourbon and Hapsburg family members. Fraser wastes space providing a chart showing how both Louis and Marie Antoinette are descended from mary Stuart--something of great interest to her, perhaps (as the foremost biographer of Mary, Queen of Scots), but not to her readers, who would benefit more from a chart explainging other things.

The gorgeous cinematography (eloquently described on the commentary by Greg Kimball) is exceptional, with exceptional black and white tonalities and use of mise en scene. And Gene Tierney, that most beautiful and inconstant of Hollywood actresses, was never more up to a script than here: her manneredness never seemed more charming, and she is quite fine in her later scenes when shes asked to be  her character in middle age (and then old age).

' A106016KSI0YQ	B000035Z3K	May 21, 2004	3	3	5.0	Superb package of materials surrounding the Browning classic	 Despite the greatness of Murnaus NOSFERATU before it and Guy Maddins DRACULA: PAGES FROM A VIRGINS DIARY after it, Tod Brownings Universal classic (the centerpiece of this cd) remains the standard version of Bram Stokers tale. In large part this is due to Brownings astonishing sets and the superbly textured deep focus cinematography of Karl Freund. The Castle Dracula, and later the vampuires stronghold in the UK, Carfax Abbey, are masterfully conveyed with giant sets and superb matte paintings. Bela Lugosis performance is nothing to compare with, say, Boris Karloffs sensitive rendition of Frankensteins monster in a nearly contemporary Universal film, but you still will see why it made him a screen legend: he is wonderfully charismatic, and he uses his long hands to spectacular effect. The mise-en-scene is often quite static, but its the tableaux from this fil one remembers: the brides of the vampire swooping down of Renfield in the castle from the foreground; Renfield (Dwight Frye, in a classic performance) staring up, grinning madly, from the belowdecks of the doomed Vesta; Dracula swooping up Mina (Helen Chandler) in the vertical slash of his cloak in the fogbound grounds of the Seward Asylum. The film provides the option of a beautiful, if incredibly obtrusive, contemporary Philip Glass score since the original film was also without music altogether (which to my mind only enhances its creepiness). Theres also the full film of the alternative Spanish-language version filmed on the same sets at night (to save money). Although many cineastes consider the Spanish version actually better than Brownings version, thanks to its enhanced eroticism, greater use of mise-en-scene and greater scene-to-scene continuity, this reviewer felt it crucially lacks the creepier static qualities of the Browning version.

' A106016KSI0YQ	B0001US600	May 20, 2004	1	2	5.0	The single best ballet movie ever	 Pairing the singular vision of Guy Maddin with the Royal Winnipeg Ballets production of "Dracula" was sheer genius: "Dracula," with its emphasis on the advent of modernity and corporeal corruption and repressed sexuality, is the ideal vehicle for Maddins peculiar talents. Whats more, using ballet dancers allowed him the opportunity to make a completely silent film (scored only with excerpts from Mahlers first and second symphonies). The results are stunning: this film has the most beautiful cinematography of any Ive seen in years, the performances are superb, and Maddin even allows his trademark campy humor to creep into the titles (though not so much that it becomes annoying). The most beautiful sequences are danced in Lucy Westenras mansion near the beginning, but the only thing is spectacular.      ',nonspam

Involving a far-reaching anarchists conspiracy masked behind the apparently random suicide of a student in the Alexander Gardens, the story is full of twists and turns, many of which you see coming (especially the character reversals). Things arent helped by the translation from the Russian, which winds up sounding exactly like a translation from a foreign language--indeed, it sounds as if it were translated from Russian to a third intervening language and then to English. And the novels final chapter seems at odds tonally with the rest of the book. On the other hand, the conspiracy itself is pretty original and interesting (although you guess whos behind it very quickly), and the story, while quite literate, is pretty much of a pageturner. Best of all, the main character, the young detective Fandorin, is very appealing. Vain but bashful, smart but naive, and supremely lucky, he does seem promising for later (and, one hopes, better) installments in the series.      ',nonspam

Its orchestrations, however, were enormously revamped and expanded, sometimes to the shows detriment (the reworking of the big finale, "the Brotherhood of Man," doesnt have the same kind of impact the original did, for example). And despite the fineness of Matthew Broderick in the lead role, he doesnt project the kind of ingratiating sexiness that made such a star out of Robert Morse. But everyone else in this re-do is superb, from Ronn Carroll as Mr. Biggley to Megan Mullaly playing the ingenue very charmingly years before she would stumble across the TV studio set as Karen Walker.

He describes much the same privileged world, but without the chocolate-box sentimentality. His characters are often moral monsters--to themselves as well as others--but they do seem real, as does the New York world of speakeasies and glamorous apartments in 1931 he describes here. His central character, Gloria Wandrous, a beautiful cosmopolitan girl living on her wits and her sex appeal, seems a clear forerunner of Sally Bowles and Holly Golightly, except she is much less madcap and much more tragic. The central action is Glorias swiping an expensive fur coat from the closets of a married wealthy new Yorker who brought her to his apartment and tore her dress off in order to date-rape her; we are then introduced to a series of characters who will all come together through the chain of events set off by Glorias taking of the coat.

You can see why by looking at this reprint edition, which carries (unfortunately in black and white newsprint reproduction) the first twenty or so issues of the relaunched series. One of the most interesting things is to see how long it took for Chris Claremont, the main writer, to get the series "right." For the first ten or so issues the stories were pretty standard early Seventies Marvel cheesiness, with far too many characters and hyperdramatic posturing (theres so much going on in the Empress  Lilandra story--featuring the introduction of not of two sets of heroes, the Starjammers and the Imperial guard, but also an entirely new Marvel interstellar empire--that its very confusing to see what kind of effect Claremont and his illustrator, dave Cockrum, had in mind). With the introduction of John Byrne into the series as the artist, however, Claremont begins to take his time with his stories, and focus on subtler characterization. The superb Mesmero story, "Mind Games," is the first where you feel both the writer and the artist are doing something truly innovative. And from then on, it just gets better and better.      ',spam

Though the movie is redeemed in part by its great wild ending (blunted in part by poor special effects), the director, Lewis Gilbert, seems to have little feel for the Gothic mode: the house itself isnt terribly scary (and doesnt even seem very large), and theres very little sense of atmosphere.

The script itself isnt much, and relies on very hoary melodramatic conventions that even seemed old in its day, and the script has its share of howlers (the famous last line, in particular).  What makes it memorable is McGuires very affecting performance, Robert Siodmaks remarkably chilling direction, and most of all the great Warren mansion itself--one of the most beautifully elaborate sets ever constructed for a Gothic. At times your eyes have trouble taking the entirety of the houses richly inhuman decorations in, and the killers ability to move in and around the house with ease seems perfectly logical.

What could be more made for the cinema than the sceance sequence with Randoplh Henry Ash and his lover Christoibel LaMotte, or the final scene at Ashs exhumed gravesite? Yet Neil LaBute and David Henry hwang seem to have been utterly baffled by the material: their adaptation of Byatts novel is pathetically pedestrian and unimaginative. Their first mistake was in casting the two modern-day lovers, Maud and Roland, with American actors: as Maud, Gwyneth Paltrow does her prissy unlikeable posh Brit schtick, and to accommodate LaButs favorite actor, the awesomely miscast Aaron Eckhradt, Roland is made an American, which makes little sense for the character or for the screenplay. Jeremy Northam fares better as Ash (though he is too young yet for the role), and Jennifer Ehle (who looks nmore and more like Meryl Streep as she ages) is by far the best cast among the principals as LaMotte. The only thing the movie really has going for it is Ehle and two other superb actresses splendidly cast as LaMottes furious and wrong lover, Blanche Glover, and Ashs pathetically trapped wife Ellen. Lena Headey and Holly Aird as (respectively) Blanche and Ellen demonstrate, with Ehle, what this adaptation might have been with a different director and screenplay writer.      ',nonspam

Certainly she is the most compulsively readable: she has a fine ability to clarify confusing historical matters and offer a clear and compelling narrative line.  This book on Samuel Pepys, her latest work, shows Tomalin at her very best. Pepys lived through (and was an important witness to) some of the most complex and drmaatic changes in British history--the Civil War, the Restoration, the Great Plague of London, the Great Fire, and the Glorious Revolution--and Tomalin presents them all so clearly and simply its a bit of a wonder. Her work is animated by her great admiration and fondness her subjects, Samuel and Elizabeth Pepys. She never shirks in showing their many faults (Pepyss sexual compulsiveness with other women, both  Pepyss physical violence towards each other and their servants) but she is also very attuned to what remarkable people they were, and how they jointly contributed (Pepys directly, Elizabeth indirectly) to one of the most remarable documents of all time: Pepyss great diary, the first great record of the Enlightenment self.

Many upper-class aspirants still religiously look to it to learn how, for example, to have their suits tailored (no "prole gap" between jacket and neck!) or decorate their living rooms. But perhaps this irony isnt so great after all. Despite the often brilliant (although now dated) observations Fussell makes, the loathing he feels for the middle classes and mockery he shows towards the "proles" really isnt balanced by any similar feelings for the upper classes, or for what Fussell designates as his own class ("class X"). Just as he describes the wealthiest of the wealthy as "out of sight," so is any pointed satire aimed towards them. Worst of all, his argument (like Freudian psychoanalysis or Marxism) is neatly unfalsifiable: any criticism you might make of his argument is neatly explained away on his terms as symptomatic of your own class insecurity, which functions as a kind of false consciousness. Its an exceptionally intelligent book, but too mean-spirited and blind to its own prejudices ultimately to be as trenchant as it means to be.      ',nonspam

But those comics by other artists (issued as #5-11 in the SPIRIT ARCHIVES series) are nothing compared to what Eisner produced before the war and certainly nothing like what he produced after it. The last book in the series ended with Eisners return to the series with his "Christmas Spirit" story for 1945; this volume is all Eisner and shows how he had become if anything even more inventive both artistically and in terms of narrative during his absence from "the Spirit." The collection introduces (and shows the exeunt) of Blubber, Ebonys Aleutian Indian replacement as the Spirits assistant, and it also introduces the great post-war villain, Mr. Carrion (and his pet buzzard Julia). But it is most noteworthy for some of the most inventive art and narrative that have ever been produced in the comics medium , particularly in the stories "The Fly," "The Last Trolley," "Magnifying Glasses" (a brilliant comics metacommentary on perspective), "The Bucket of Blood" and "The Rubber Band." This shows the beginning of probably the best work (and certainly the most original) done in the comics medium since "Little Nemo in Slumberland."      ',spam
' A106016KSI0YQ	6304018959	January 17, 2004	22	23	5.0	A masterpiece encompassing many kingdoms	 The Kingdom is the name of a gargantuan decaying hosital in Copenhagen where this amazing Lars von Trier Gothic television miniseries is set. of course, the title also refers to the kingdom of Denmark (in the staff meeting room where many scenes take place, the portraits of Queen Margrethe and her consort are prominently displayed), for which the hospital is a metaphor, and for the kingdom of society in general. And, as von Trier explains in his charming afterwords to the episodes, it also refers to the kingdom of the imagination itself.  The miniseries works on all these levels. Its a quirky, incredibly atmospheric study of the hospital centering upon the discovery of the ghost of a girl murdered 75 years previously on the same site haunting the hospital, and it revolves around a giant cast of dozens of memorable characters, all of whom are intensely sympathetic even though theyre pretty miserable human beings. The three at the core of the story are a malingerer, the septuagenarian medium Mrs. Drusse, obsessed with discovering the story behind a ghost; a blackmailer, the young and sexy Dr. Hook; and his nemesis in the neurology department, the jaw-droppingly arrogant brain surgeon Dr. Helmer, who had to take this job in Denmark (which he loathes) after being cast out of a job in his native Sweden under suspicion of plagiarism. Although the Gothic aspects to the story are beautifully brought out by the labyrinthine deserted basement hallways of the hospital and Von Triers gorgeous sepia-tinted cinemtography, like all the best ghost stories the ghosts here serve as metaphors for whats wrong with the state of society in general. The miniseries is an amazingly funny satire on the dilapidated Danish health care system, and the films funniest moments involve the attempts of the neurology departments manager, the marvelously manipulative and passive-aggressive Professor Moesgaard, to implement a hilariously inane PR campaign called "Operation Morning Air" that involves (among other things) having the neurosurgeons cheerfully sing introductions to one another at staff meetings. The series has often been compared to "Twin Peaks," but its probably even better. Like the Lynch series it does a marvelous job of conveying atmosphere, but it is deeper and more carefully engineered and imagined. Though there are moments that sag (including the disastrous idea of having Dr. Helmer visit Haiti near the end, which jarringly breaks the miniseries adherence otherwise to the Aristotelean unities by and large), as a whole it is a genuine masterpiece. It is one of the richest works for television ever made.      ',spam

Realizing shes seeing the dead, Mun and her doctor become determined to help her find the donor of the corneas. The ideas behind this film are much better than the execution. The creators, the Pang brothers, have a tremendous visual sense so the screen compositions are often extraordinary. But oddly enough in a film where so much depends on seeing what the heroine sees, the film suffers from weak shot-to-shot continuity: often youre not quite sure what Mun sees as she sees it, which makes thematic sense given her own trouble believing and understanding her visions but that greatly interferes with the suspense. Only afterwards do you realize how frightening the sequence MIGHT have been had it only been edited slightly differently and with a different kind of kinetic rhythm: in the restaurant scene, in the elevator scene, and even in the crucial bedroom scene in Thailand near the end. Only the sequence in the hospital hallway near the beginning and the great scene in the calligraphy classroom seem to achieve the effects the filmmakers intended.      ',nonspam

P. Lovecraft  was proudly one of the most preeminent). The three most famous stories in this book--the title story, "The Wendigo," and above all "The Willows"--emblematize his skill. The title story is set in an ancient French townn where the townspeople seem to have a peculair habit of transforming into something else, and authentically captures the creepiness of medieval towns at night. Even more frightening is "The Wendigo": set in the North Woods, it realizes whatever fears youve ever had walking alone in the snowy woods. "The Willows" was Lovecrafts nomination for the finest horror stopry ever written, and it clearly may have inspired THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT: two canoers traversing through the Middle European forests find themselves stranded on an island by unknown forces that wont let them leave. Part of the pleasure of Blackwood is that he never overdoes it: he has a marvelous light touch, and reads quite crisply at the level of the sentence.      ',spam

Working almost exclusively in watercolor gouache, he brought a photorealistic style that takes almost everyones breath away. It marvelously recaptures the essential thrill of comic books: the fantasy of what it would be like if a man could really fly, or run at incredible speeds, or had a magic ring that could do anything. Hes often been compared to Norman Rockwell (in his hyperrealism and love of dramatic facial expression), but Ross is his own artist. His intense love of dramatic composition, lighting, and figural motion suggests his roots also extend to the greats of comic artwork, including Dick Sprang, Steve Ditko, Gil Kane, and Neal Adams. This wonderful collection captures many of his childhood attempts at art and documents not only his changing style but also his creative process (using live and inanimate models, photography, and high-contrast lighting). It also showcases a plethora of his best work for DC, and even includes many rare and uncollected images done for fan publications and even a collectors plates series (!). The fancy-shmancy book design by designer and comics fan Chip Kidd is sometimes a drawback (too many images are sometimes crammed into one doublepage spread, reducing the detail to the detriment of all the images), but the book is terrific nonetheless. It greatly benefits from commentary by Ross throughout explaining what he finds interesting and exciting about each classic Golden and Silver Age comics character.      ',spam

The Metcalfs, professors at the UCalifornia schools, remedy this slant in their new CONCISE HISTORY OF INDIA by stacking the deck against European colonialism. While this is welcome, it is not without cost. The greatest, perhaps, is that the Metcalfs often seem to great length to vilify some figures or parties while at pains elsewhere to vindicate others . While their biases are understandable (even ones with which I basically agree), this does not make for the most balanced or objective of histories. More worrying is their utter dryness of tone: it would be hard to imagine anyone being introduced to India (presumably the books target audience) finding this book anything other than a painful chore. key figures or concepts are introduced basically offhand, then circled back to discuss in greater length much later when youve forgotten who or what they were; very minor figures from the nations history or culture are often brought forth to comment on the events, but the authors do not clarify whether these commentators are important or central or not. There are good maps, and a useful beginning glossary, but I would have to recommend John Keays book (for all its European bias) as a much more readable introduction to India than this one.

James close to the top of her form, but while this latest entrant in the series is not as distasteful as some of the worst books in it (such as A TASTE FOR DEATH), neither does it show her at her most cunning. The setting is somewhat typical for James: a Victorian house with interesting architecture converted into the Dupayne Museum, a small institution devoted to the cultural and social history of the Interwar period. The Dupayne heirs, a squabbling set of siblings (one of whom is of course soon murdered), also seem very much a typical bunch of Jamesian suspects. But the first one hundred pages setting the scene and introducing the characters is inordinately humdrum. We are told repeatedly how uninteresting the Dupayne is, and the characters all seem, like their creator, with a peculiarly circumspect and distanced vision of their lives and everyone elses: they all seem vaguely nihilistic and biding their time until the grave. Only when the first murder occurs do things perk up considerably in terms of interest, both for the Dupayne and the cast of characters, and then things do get humming and James seems to snap out of her writerly doldrum. The novels other unhappy feature is its unconnected subplot involving the ever-distant Commander Dagliesh and his bloodless romance with the sickeningly perfect Emma Laversham, introduced in the previous (and far superior) Dagliesh mystery DEATH IN HOLY ORDERS. Why James wanted to continue with Emmas colorless character is a greater mystery than anything Dagliesh or his subordinates encounter in the novel itself.      ',nonspam

It plays like Noel Cowards CAVALCADE in reverse. It opens in 1940, when war against a foreign power is declared at Christmastime (these are the best and most famous sequences, and are performed nearly like a kind of pantomime). Then the film advances episodically at first about decade at a time, showing the devastation wrought by war and plague, the barbarian society that becomes built over the carnage, and finally the superscientific cryptofascistic organization that defeats the barbarian power and its own problems. Aside from Alfred Hitchcocks work, british cinema just wasnt very good prior to the Second World War, and this film shows why: everyone from the evil barbarian dictator and his Lady MacBeth to the children in the street speak with absurdly posh BBC accents, and theres a ridiculous amount of posturing and posing. The film is mostly of interest today as a kind of curio, especially in its relaization onscreen of the popular futuristic fantsies of the period: giant Art Deco turbines, and oversized flying wing aircrafts that sweep the skies. The striking visualization of the Wings over the World society, with its towers and plazas, and its citizenry bedecked in caped togas with plastic tubing (the costumes were co-designed by the Marchioness of Queensbury!) clearly provided the inspiration for DC Comics illustrators in the United States in their depictions of Supermans Krypton for the next fifty years or so.

FAIRY TALE: A TRUE STORY garnered more attention, and largely took the childrens perspective; this little thriller from the same year used the tale more as a point of departure, imagining instead an adult fantasy with erotic and philosophical overtones about a photographer haunted by the death of his first wife who becomes involved in a similar incident. The film has unusual and wonderful effects that stay with you for a long time, and wish it were up to the ambitions the first-time director, Nick Willing, clearly had for it. Unfortunately, his inexperience shows, and the odd bridge he tries to naviagte between fantasy and realism doesnt always hold together. His use of expressionistic techniques--the bloodied head of the hero at the funeral, the linking image of the pocketwatch (brought out even when the hero is in a full body cast!)--just seem silly rather than evocative. The film has an unusual hero in Toby Stephens: while not very sympathetic, hes a superb actor, and his decided carnality and corporeality work startling effects on the character. Unfortunately, these same qualities makes it impossible to believe that Ben Kingsley (of all people), as a grieving country vicar, could ever get the better of Stephens so many times physically as he does in the film. Still, the ambition of the film, and its many evocative images, make you wish it were released on DVD with a directors or writers commentary.      ',nonspam

Many directors with low budgets and great imaginations have thus turned to the genre, producing such classic variations on the theme as I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, THE EVIL DEAD, and 28 DAYS LATER. But they all owe a debt back to this, probably the first "true" zombie film. Fortunately, this Haiti-set film holds up beautifully, with wonderfully evocative images. Theres a completely wordless satanic mill, where the silence isnt even broken by the fall of one of the zombies into the great millstone; a haunted ruined castle by the sea like something out of Dor ; a vulture that is used to wonderful effect  in the films last moments; and a beautiful undead heroine stalking around in her filmy negligee. (Inevitably shes named "Madeleine," so her irritating boyfriend can call after her, in BBC tones, "Oh, Madeleine... Madeleine... oh, Madeleine...")

Although it is second in the Chronicles of Barset, I greatly recommend starting here if you have never read Trollope before rather than beginning with the first book in the series, THE WARDEN: youll quickly pick up everything you needed to know that happened in the first book at the beginning of BARCHESTER TOWERS, and this is a much, much funnier novel (and is more likely to hook you into his way of seeing the world).  BARCHESTER TOWERS is the greatest novel of petty infighting ever written: it anticipates (and surpasses) the many British and American college novels written in the twentieth century. Very little happens in this novel: two old clergymen die in the course of this novel and have replacements chosen for them, and a widow is re-married. But to the inhabitants of Trollopes Barchester it is nothing less than all-out war, waged between the archdeacons faction (representing the conservative church) on one hand and the new bishops wife, Mrs. Proudie, and her chaplain Mr. Slope (representing the "Low Church" movement) on the other. Everyone else, including the henpecked bishop, is caught in the middle. There are two absolutely uproarious setpieces in this novel: the reception Mrs. Proudie throws at the bishops palace, and the hilariously quaint medieval fair held at the country seat of Ullathorne (complete with such ghastly oddities as a quintain for practicing jousting) are as funny as anything Jane Austen ever wrote. Trollope may not have had Austens genius for presenting ethical quandaries, but he comes second only to her as the great novelist of comic manners in the 19th century.      ',spam
' A106016KSI0YQ	067972883X	December 19, 2003	5	8	3.0	Stacks its deck too unfairly	 Weltys Pulitzer Prize-winning novel is largely told in the third person through the observations of its heroine, Laurel McKelva Hand, the daughter of a prominent and wealthy smalltown Mississippi judge who comes to New Orleans to help her father who must see a doctor for an eye affliction. On hand is the judges second wife, the silly and vulgar Fay, whom Laurel and the doctor basically ignore. When the father unexpectedly dies, Laurel (who is older than Fay) must return to the smalltown with her stepmother for his funeral. The reasons for Weltys popularity with THE NEW YORKER editorial board are much in evidence: the story is told subtly and in small pieces, and accrues a remarkable level of hospital and genteel smalltown detail as it proceeds. Its measured rhythms are the best thing this novel has going for it. Unfortunately, it seems to proceed too much along the lines of a contest between discreet Southern gentility and refinement (embodied in the quiet and grieiving Laurel) and no-count Southern lower-class vulgarity (championed by Fay and her obnoxious Texas relatives). Although Laurel comes to realize why her fathers late-life optimism explains why he married Fay, Welty doesnt really allow Fay any sort of appeal to the reader at all, and so you finish the novel thinking how much *nicer* everything would have been had the judge never married her. (At least Tennessee Williams allowed Stanley Kowalski animal magnetism.) The novel seems too much on the side of delicacy , especially given that Weltys own fine feelings are so manifest in her method of telling of the story--though paradoxically some overobvious symbols (a carved boat, a breadboard, the judges degenerating eye) weigh things down a bit much. The work is most interesting at the end, when Laurel must confront some truths about her real  mothers final illness which complicate the overly schematic family alignments in some welcome ways.
